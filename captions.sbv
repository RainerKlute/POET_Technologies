Hi, good day everybody, good morning, afternoon,
evening wherever you are in the world. I am

0:00:10.790,0:00:18.050
Dr. Suresh Venkatesan. I’m the chairman
and CEO of POET Technologies and I want to

0:00:18.050,0:00:24.140
provide you with a short update on on the
company and what we’ve achieved over the

0:00:24.140,0:00:44.491
past year. Let'’s see if I can get this
working. Have you used ChatGPT lately? Questions

0:00:44.491,0:00:51.719
like this signal the increasing presence of
AI in our tech-heavy world. AI, generative

0:00:51.719,0:00:58.320
AI, artificial intelligence is all the rage
these days. Do you know what the biggest challenge

0:00:58.320,0:01:05.070
with AI is today? It’s power, energy! I
was at a conference on this topic the other

0:01:05.070,0:01:13.160
day. Apparently the power required to program
the 175 billion parameters in ChatGPT runs

0:01:13.160,0:01:21.180
over a gigawatt! Just by contrast: The human
brain consumes 25 watts of power for similar

0:01:21.180,0:01:28.060
operations. That is quite a chasm to cross!
But one way to begin to address the power

0:01:28.060,0:01:34.659
challenge is to convert data transmission
to optics, data communications over optical

0:01:34.659,0:01:43.159
fiber, using light as the carrier dominates,
because it is 10 times faster, uses 10 times

0:01:43.159,0:01:51.760
less power and produces much less heat than
electrons flowing through copper. Nothing

0:01:51.760,0:01:59.549
else can do what photonics can do to increase
bandwidth and speed while reducing latency

0:01:59.549,0:02:07.690
and power consumption. So what does POET do?
POET makes optical modules that enable optical

0:02:07.690,0:02:18.280
data transmission. And this is fundamental
to scaling the presence of AI. Others make

0:02:18.280,0:02:26.290
optical modules as well. But POET has developed
unique intellectual property that allows us

0:02:26.290,0:02:36.020
to make these modules better, cheaper, lower
power and larger scale than anyone else. More

0:02:36.020,0:02:45.170
than cost or bill of sales it is the scale
where POET shines. And by scale we mean the

0:02:45.170,0:02:54.650
number of units that can be economically produced.
POET has semiconductorized photonics packaging

0:02:54.650,0:03:01.450
and put it squarely on the same trajectory
as semiconductors. Semiconductorization of

0:03:01.450,0:03:08.250
photonics using POET’s proprietary Optical
Interposer provides unprecedented scale and

0:03:08.250,0:03:16.940
economy for the rapidly growing AI and optical
communications market. In fact it's our belief

0:03:16.940,0:03:22.530
that it's not possible to address these markets
that need hundreds of millions or billions

0:03:22.530,0:03:30.120
of these devices any other way. Integration
is the key. Semiconductorization is the key.

0:03:30.120,0:03:37.129
And we believe we have pioneered this art
of semiconductorization of photonics packaging.

0:03:37.129,0:03:44.530
And that means terrific potential in a large
growing and increasingly relevant market in

0:03:44.530,0:03:54.490
AI and co-packaged optics. We have come a
long way over the past year with many accomplishments

0:03:54.490,0:04:02.520
under our belt. We serve a very large market
worth billions of dollars, particularly in

0:04:02.520,0:04:10.560
data communications and AI. We're squarely
in the supply chain for AI hardware. We have

0:04:10.560,0:04:16.700
a super unique and patented technology that
provides us with a source of sustained competitive

0:04:16.700,0:04:22.600
differentiation across a number of market
verticals including AI and high performance

0:04:22.600,0:04:31.070
computing. We have an exciting product roadmap,
born out of six years of technology and product

0:04:31.070,0:04:37.320
development. We've partnered with some of
the largest optical companies in the world,

0:04:37.320,0:04:44.820
like Lumentum, Broadcom, Macom. We have a
pipeline of customers across the world and

0:04:44.820,0:04:51.130
design wins that could total more than 150
million dollars of revenue over a three-year

0:04:51.130,0:04:59.280
period. We have a majority stake in a manufacturing
joint venture that could alone have an asset

0:04:59.280,0:05:12.350
value of over 200 million over the next two
to three years. The prime motivator for optics

0:05:12.350,0:05:18.660
and data communications and AI is power and
latency. Light as we have mentioned is 10x

0:05:18.660,0:05:23.310
faster and 10x lower power and has ruled the
roost when it comes to long distance data

0:05:23.310,0:05:32.620
communications. In fact, photonics 1.0 was
driven by submarine communications, long-distance

0:05:32.620,0:05:40.000
communications; use optics as the medium for
that communication to occur. However, as bandwidth

0:05:40.000,0:05:45.050
– meaning the amount of information that
is communicated per second – keeps increasing,

0:05:45.050,0:05:52.319
the distance over which this data is communicated
with light has become shorter and shorter.

0:05:52.319,0:06:01.550
Photonics 2.0, data centers, key driver for
optics. So optics is now in data centers,

0:06:01.550,0:06:08.470
is used for communications when distances
exceed about five meters. With AI, the bandwidth

0:06:08.470,0:06:14.280
and power crunch is so severe that there is
now a need to utilize optics as a means to

0:06:14.280,0:06:21.259
communicate data even between individual components,
like graphics and memory. The volume and scale

0:06:21.259,0:06:28.690
of these AI applications quickly trumps the
more conventional data center applications.

0:06:28.690,0:06:33.810
And the greater the need, the greater we feel
POET’s solutions in the space will begin

0:06:33.810,0:06:48.479
to gain favor. AI is the killer app for photonics
3.0. So the market for POET solutions spans

0:06:48.479,0:06:54.030
the more traditional data centers and data
communications which includes of course enterprise

0:06:54.030,0:07:00.889
and telecom applications and the new and emerging
market around AI-driven needs for optics.

0:07:00.889,0:07:07.729
In fact, we believe the AI-driven needs are
going to trump the more conventional data

0:07:07.729,0:07:14.150
center interconnects that has really been
kind of the prime driver for the past decade.

0:07:14.150,0:07:20.870
Both of these markets are large and growing.
They exceed 12 billion dollars in TAM by 2025.

0:07:20.870,0:07:28.810
The inflection point for growth in these markets
begins next year, and POET is well poised

0:07:28.810,0:07:35.220
with both solutions and customer access this
year. And we are well-positioned to intercept

0:07:35.220,0:07:53.699
this market at the right time with our differentiated
solutions. So the key challenges in photonics,

0:07:53.699,0:08:01.729
especially when it comes to very large scale
in terms of volume, is really the ability

0:08:01.729,0:08:10.199
to build millions, billions of these devices.
And conventional photonics packaging technology

0:08:10.199,0:08:16.530
simply will not fit the bill. I mean, those
solutions have been designed and have been

0:08:16.530,0:08:22.590
developed and honed over 30 years. But they
were first designed for single-channel applications.

0:08:22.590,0:08:28.889
Then they were designed for quad applications,
where the base technology was scaled through

0:08:28.889,0:08:36.810
engineering. But today, the applications demand
eight channels, 16 channels. They demand hundreds

0:08:36.810,0:08:42.620
of millions of units a year, not millions
of units a year. And there comes a point where

0:08:42.620,0:08:50.080
these conventional technologies simply cannot
fit the bill. Absolutely possible to engineer

0:08:50.080,0:09:00.190
in prototype quantities. But try to scale
that with good economies and economics! That's

0:09:00.190,0:09:06.399
where POET comes in. Our vision has always
been wafer-scale integration of known-good-die

0:09:06.399,0:09:14.411
components that address the pinch points of
volume, size, cost, power consumption. These

0:09:14.411,0:09:21.290
are the areas where we believe our technology
ticks the boxes – consistently –, and

0:09:21.290,0:09:29.080
that is the beauty of what POET has invented,
which is the Optical Interposer. The Optical

0:09:29.080,0:09:37.080
Interposer enables what we call chip-scale,
wafer-level packaging. In the world today,

0:09:37.080,0:09:44.650
in semiconductors, wafer-level, chip-scale
packaging is the norm. You look at your cell

0:09:44.650,0:09:49.120
phone, you look at these devices that are
in high-performance computing: They're all

0:09:49.120,0:09:57.529
built with wafer-level, chip-scale packaging,
where discrete electronics die are put together

0:09:57.529,0:10:07.260
into a chip-scale package. TSMC would call
that CoWoS. Intel calls it EMIB. But basically

0:10:07.260,0:10:12.870
it's wafer-level, chip-scale packaging. We're
the first company in the world to adapt wafer-level,

0:10:12.870,0:10:18.890
chip-scale packaging to photonics. So now,
instead of just integrating electronic die

0:10:18.890,0:10:24.860
we're able to mix and match photonics and
electronics die on a wafer-scale packaging

0:10:24.860,0:10:31.230
platform. That's what we call the POET Optical
Interposer. And we've been successfully deploying

0:10:31.230,0:10:37.570
these interposer-based solutions into a number
of products after basically having developed

0:10:37.570,0:10:51.520
the platform initially. The benefits to customers
are of course cost, size, scale, and power

0:10:51.520,0:11:01.060
consumption. We believe, especially as you
go forward in high-frequency data communications,

0:11:01.060,0:11:07.600
the RF performance benefits of an optical
interposer result ultimately in lower power

0:11:07.600,0:11:12.930
consumption. Of course there's the big conversion
of copper to optics and that is a big piece

0:11:12.930,0:11:20.389
of that too. More importantly, with the optical
interposers is that our customers who adopt

0:11:20.389,0:11:27.260
interposer-based engine solutions can lower
their CapEx bill by by a factor of 10, because

0:11:27.260,0:11:35.100
we do all the integration onto the optical
engine. That is kind of cut both ways for

0:11:35.100,0:11:42.510
us. You know, on the one hand new and upcoming
module makers that have not invested in that

0:11:42.510,0:11:48.360
CapEx really love it because they take advantage
of this huge reduction in CapEx from their

0:11:48.360,0:11:55.639
perspective to adopt our solutions, But on
the flip side bigger, larger, well-established

0:11:55.639,0:12:04.190
module makers that have already invested in
warehouses of capital and warehouses of people,

0:12:04.190,0:12:10.510
it's a little bit more difficult for them
to switch and adopt a solution that largely

0:12:10.510,0:12:15.449
eliminates a lot of their value, which is
putting it together by buying an integrated

0:12:15.449,0:12:21.209
solution from POET. So that has cut us both
ways. I mean, it's learning for us as we go

0:12:21.209,0:12:28.440
forward in our progress. But I think what
is clear is the value proposition that the

0:12:28.440,0:12:34.100
technology has overall, and that's the platform,
the technology that we've developed, which

0:12:34.100,0:12:42.750
also provides versatility for a number of
multiple applications. From a manufacturing

0:12:42.750,0:12:51.910
standpoint, we've established a joint venture.
We've worked with Sanan IC in 2019. It was

0:12:51.910,0:12:59.779
important for POET to ensure that there was
a high-volume manufacturing path for its optical

0:12:59.779,0:13:08.130
engine solutions. As a small company we leveraged
other people's money in this context. We created

0:13:08.130,0:13:15.070
a joint venture POET has not invested a dime
in creating this joint venture manufacturing

0:13:15.070,0:13:25.709
capability – not a dime. We've provided
know-how, no IP, and we've leveraged that

0:13:25.709,0:13:34.389
know-how to create a manufacturing asset,
a clean room, equipment, people. That's what

0:13:34.389,0:13:40.120
is required to ultimately scale up the technology.
And as a small company, we've been able to

0:13:40.120,0:13:46.519
leverage Sanan. Sanan is the world's largest
provider of compound semiconductors in terms

0:13:46.519,0:13:53.620
of LEDs. They recently launched a 3.2 billion
dollar joint venture with ST Microelectronics

0:13:53.620,0:14:00.829
to do silicon-carbide chips. I mean, these
guys know manufacturing. And they want this

0:14:00.829,0:14:06.881
joint venture to be successful, and they've
been investing into it. This joint venture

0:14:06.881,0:14:14.920
now takes our optical interposers and converts
them into optical engines through wafer-level

0:14:14.920,0:14:22.120
assembly techniques. And these optical engines
are then sold to optical module makers and

0:14:22.120,0:14:34.980
in some cases back to POET, where POET makes
the end module. A word on Super Photonics.

0:14:34.980,0:14:41.160
It's a latent value that we have created in
this company that we believe doesn't get enough

0:14:41.160,0:14:48.389
recognition for what we've been able to deliver.
There was a joint venture we formed in 2020

0:14:48.389,0:14:55.360
between POET and Sanan IC just as Covid was
breaking out. Its mission is to assemble,

0:14:55.360,0:15:06.060
test, package, and sell optical engines, based
completely on POET's optical interposal technology.

0:15:06.060,0:15:10.959
We formed the company in 2019, the Chinese
company. It was independently valued at 50

0:15:10.959,0:15:18.680
million US dollars at formation. For POET,
it enables a fab-light manufacturing model

0:15:18.680,0:15:25.720
with no investment by POET. We spent all our
cash on R&D. Somebody else is enabling us

0:15:25.720,0:15:32.930
to scale it into manufacturing. If POET ourselves
had to set up that manufacturing entity, we

0:15:32.930,0:15:37.270
would have had to raise so much more money
to be able to create this capability but we

0:15:37.270,0:15:45.079
didn't. We created a joint venture, we got
a partner involved, and they have now invested

0:15:45.079,0:15:51.760
10 million dollars and change. They're committed
to investing another 15 million dollars to

0:15:51.760,0:15:59.050
scale this up over the next six months. We've
employed 38 employees. They've been able to

0:15:59.050,0:16:04.899
take our technology prototypes that we've
developed in Singapore and demonstrate scale

0:16:04.899,0:16:12.760
and yield and capability that is truly impressive.
In fact, I was there six weeks ago, first

0:16:12.760,0:16:20.500
time ever since we formed the joint venture
as China is now opened up and and we're able

0:16:20.500,0:16:29.569
to travel freely with our old visas. Terrific
stuff! The goal for the Super Photonics joint

0:16:29.569,0:16:36.120
venture is the IPO in China in 2026/2027.
We currently own a 80 percent equity stake

0:16:36.120,0:16:43.079
in this joint venture. At the time of IPO,
we would probably be closer to 50 percent.

0:16:43.079,0:16:50.250
Even today, there is strong interest from
China-based PE firms in owning a piece of

0:16:50.250,0:16:59.639
Super Photonics. And valuations for photonics
in China are huge, valuations for photonics

0:16:59.639,0:17:06.209
in China for innovative technologies even
bigger, and once that innovative technology

0:17:06.209,0:17:12.470
starts turning revenue that valuation skyrockets.
We believe that this joint venture could be

0:17:12.470,0:17:18.900
worth over 200 million dollars in the next
couple to three years, as soon as Super Photonics

0:17:18.900,0:17:28.199
starts generating revenue in amount, which
we think will be in a couple of years. I mean,

0:17:28.199,0:17:32.850
that is just absolute latent value that we
have created and our ability to capture that

0:17:32.850,0:17:39.970
value is to be able to sell our equity stake
in that joint venture that provides a non-dilutive

0:17:39.970,0:17:49.260
source of financing for the company to do
other things: more R&D, more products. So

0:17:49.260,0:17:59.290
we think that we're sitting on really great
value. And I commend Vivek and team for their

0:17:59.290,0:18:06.760
efforts and being able to set this up and
for the the overall POET organization to support

0:18:06.760,0:18:20.830
creating what we believe is a very high-value
capability for the company going forward.

0:18:20.830,0:18:25.690
Our line of optical engines. This is what
they look like. If you guys have seen semiconductor

0:18:25.690,0:18:31.500
chips you will know what I'm talking about.
These are photonics sub-assemblies. They look

0:18:31.500,0:18:39.760
like semiconductor chips. On the left are
our 800G receivers as well as transmitters.

0:18:39.760,0:18:46.220
We announced just two weeks ago that we are
starting to sample our alphas of a 400G/800G

0:18:46.220,0:18:55.870
scalable transmitter, first of the kind in
the industry, first company to use DML lasers

0:18:55.870,0:19:04.120
and generate 400G/800G capability. In fact,
when we presented the data to Lumentum they

0:19:04.120,0:19:08.640
acknowledged that we're the first company
that they have sold these DML to that have

0:19:08.640,0:19:14.950
actually transformed these DMLs into a working
product. And we did prototypes at the OFC,

0:19:14.950,0:19:20.670
we are doing samples now and six months later.
We are well on track with our roadmap to be

0:19:20.670,0:19:27.299
able to take this into production early next
year. On the extreme right hand side, you

0:19:27.299,0:19:33.690
see our product. This is specifically for
DVA. Again, first of the kind in the world!

0:19:33.690,0:19:41.860
A full chip-on-board implementation of a 16-lane
architecture that fits inside of a QSFP-DD

0:19:41.860,0:19:49.760
form factor. It's a 16-lane product! ADVA
didn't have any other path to making this.

0:19:49.760,0:19:55.429
We were the only choice. They're actively
architecting this. They have a customer business

0:19:55.429,0:20:03.010
that is keenly awaiting this product to be
made available to them. And so we're stoked.

0:20:03.010,0:20:11.210
In this particular case we made this product
line happen through our innovation. And these

0:20:11.210,0:20:17.440
products are now ready and basically awaiting
ADVA to have their module design completed,

0:20:17.440,0:20:22.710
so that they can take it into production,
and there's obviously a lot of motivation

0:20:22.710,0:20:29.590
on their part to do that given the uniqueness
of the solution in the market. We're also

0:20:29.590,0:20:36.230
the first company to do wafer-level remote
laser solutions for co-packaged optics and

0:20:36.230,0:20:47.929
AI. Our product release plans for 2023 and
2024. We have come a long way. About a year

0:20:47.929,0:20:54.410
ago, we were demonstrating 100G products.
One year later, we're demonstrating 800 gigabit

0:20:54.410,0:21:03.230
products, sampling 800 gigabits today. We've
released our 100G receivers as well as transmitters,

0:21:03.230,0:21:09.870
and we have three additional variants on the
100G. One is what we call POET One or the

0:21:09.870,0:21:15.360
fully-integrated single-chip TXRX solution.
This is going to be a product that we're going

0:21:15.360,0:21:24.070
to take into the telecom market in China with
our customer BFYY and their end customers,

0:21:24.070,0:21:33.669
the likes of China Mobile. So that will be
released at the end of Q3. We also have LR4

0:21:33.669,0:21:41.870
products, not just the one we did for ADVA
but conventional LR4, that there are at least

0:21:41.870,0:21:51.020
four customers that were sampling to today.
Again, will be released in Q3. We completed

0:21:51.020,0:21:59.830
our beta for our 200G products. That'll be
released in Q3 as well. 400G receivers have

0:21:59.830,0:22:06.809
been released. 800G receivers and transmitters
end of the year. You can count the number

0:22:06.809,0:22:12.299
of products we're going to be releasing this
year. It is insane but it's possible because

0:22:12.299,0:22:18.970
of our our interposer technology the platform
approach, the fact that we use known good

0:22:18.970,0:22:25.960
components. And the moment we've been able
to ally with some of the top optical component

0:22:25.960,0:22:33.280
suppliers we've been able to demonstrate the
value that the engine provides in this context,

0:22:33.280,0:22:46.220
which is converting a DML laser into an engine,
with good RF in enhanced capability. And what

0:22:46.220,0:22:52.200
POET would like to do is to be able to generate
modules for 800G, which is critical not just

0:22:52.200,0:23:02.870
for data communications like custom modules
for 800G are also used extensively in AI.

0:23:02.870,0:23:08.630
On the other side, we have a set of remote
light source products that we are still developing.

0:23:08.630,0:23:17.470
I think our goal is to be able to really expand
our portfolio in the space with key investments

0:23:17.470,0:23:22.260
that we want to be able to make, where we
believe that we have the ability to really

0:23:22.260,0:23:28.640
make a a very meaningful contribution in this
growing market of artificial intelligence,

0:23:28.640,0:23:36.679
not just because we might have extremely differentiated
DML-based 800 gigabit modules but also very

0:23:36.679,0:23:46.720
differentiated remote light sources. We've
been really busy as a company. Year to date

0:23:46.720,0:23:55.159
in 2023, we've announced key engagements with
customers: ADVA, Luxshare. Luxshare is a billion

0:23:55.159,0:24:03.080
dollar company. They sell primarily to Apple
and others, and they've got a business and

0:24:03.080,0:24:11.659
an access to the hyperscale market. We're
designed-in already with their 800 gigabit

0:24:11.659,0:24:19.390
solutions with our receivers. In fact, we've
gotten initial yields, these are sample-quantity

0:24:19.390,0:24:27.420
POs which is common early in the development
where we provide engines for them to be able

0:24:27.420,0:24:36.250
to develop their modules. BFYY: our first
foray into telecom. the exposure into a really

0:24:36.250,0:24:42.480
large market there, which are the mobile players,
the big mobile players, and the telecom stakes

0:24:42.480,0:24:51.390
in China. The POET Infinity product line:
We announced our engagement with Celestial

0:24:51.390,0:24:57.100
with this new class of products for their
applications. We've received the purchase

0:24:57.100,0:25:09.240
order from them for supplying product next
year. And we also announced some product announcements

0:25:09.240,0:25:15.049
around the lines of Infinity, announced the
availability of these products sampling of

0:25:15.049,0:25:24.279
800G. It it's been a busy year, and we expect
that as we release more products over the

0:25:24.279,0:25:30.820
next couple of quarters to be able to announce
additional customers, additional engagements,

0:25:30.820,0:25:36.549
and we do believe that we can keep up with
what needs to be done in terms of kind of

0:25:36.549,0:25:47.790
gaining traction and gaining engagement around
this platform. We have 11 current projects

0:25:47.790,0:25:58.090
with seven key customers, and just these projects
represent a combined 150 million dollars of

0:25:58.090,0:26:06.620
revenue potential over three years – just
these projects, nothing new. But we do expect

0:26:06.620,0:26:10.850
something new. We've got another a bunch of
products that we're planning to release over

0:26:10.850,0:26:15.020
the course of the next couple of months, and
we do believe that when those products are

0:26:15.020,0:26:22.679
released there will be more take up, more
engagements. But based on what our customers

0:26:22.679,0:26:29.070
tell us about these products and when they
intend to ramp and their potential forecasts

0:26:29.070,0:26:38.250
for these products, we estimate that for POET
and Super Photonics this can be a cumulative

0:26:38.250,0:26:43.150
150 million dollars of revenue potential.
So, if they're successful, we're going to

0:26:43.150,0:26:49.799
be successful, too. And it's important for
us to project and plan because we need to

0:26:49.799,0:26:55.299
have the manufacturing capability to be able
to deliver this. And that's where Super Photonics

0:26:55.299,0:27:02.120
comes in, and that's where the additional
investments from Sanan are going to be placed.

0:27:02.120,0:27:09.440
Today, our technology and business strategy
is fundamentally centered around building

0:27:09.440,0:27:16.929
interposers and optical engines and providing
expertise to end customers or module makers

0:27:16.929,0:27:23.799
providing finished modules. While we believe
that this is a reasonable model for kind of

0:27:23.799,0:27:32.640
the legacy, if you will, or 100G to 200G to
400G, especially in the AI segment we think

0:27:32.640,0:27:40.539
we have to transcend beyond the optical engine
and create optical modules. So, the future

0:27:40.539,0:27:48.200
for POET is to actually create optical modules,
and we believe we can do that because a big

0:27:48.200,0:27:53.660
portion of the optical module is already factored
into the engine. We've integrated tiers, we've

0:27:53.660,0:27:59.019
integrated drivers, we've got very good RF
capability on the interposer, we've got all

0:27:59.019,0:28:03.840
the photonics components on the interposer,
we create effectively everything except the

0:28:03.840,0:28:11.000
DSP. So our intent is to add a third set of
capabilities for design and development of

0:28:11.000,0:28:15.840
these optical modules. We're already doing
it for AI. It's a critical requirement for

0:28:15.840,0:28:21.390
AI. So our intent in AI is clearly to have
optical modules generated. So, that doesn't

0:28:21.390,0:28:25.850
mean that we're going to stop selling engines
to module makers. I think in the advanced

0:28:25.850,0:28:33.929
technology, specifically for AI, our intent
would be to create optical modules. It enables

0:28:33.929,0:28:41.769
the sale of our leading edge products directly
to the end customer without having to go through

0:28:41.769,0:28:48.890
this middleman and this long process of getting
designed-in and the iterations associated

0:28:48.890,0:28:53.980
with more development to be done along the
way. It reduces time to market, eliminates

0:28:53.980,0:29:00.220
qualification cycles. We think it's the right
thing to do. It requires some investment,

0:29:00.220,0:29:07.649
and we're looking at an alternate joint venture
capability that allows us to potentially fund

0:29:07.649,0:29:16.920
this activity. Again, raising money with some
non-dilutive financing here. In 2020, when

0:29:16.920,0:29:25.410
we created the joint venture in China, China
was in fashion. We were complimented for having

0:29:25.410,0:29:32.321
done that. Today, I read the boards and of
course everybody barfs on the fact that we

0:29:32.321,0:29:39.510
have manufacturing in China. But it is important
to understand that it is a very, very, very

0:29:39.510,0:29:50.799
large market. It is in fact the largest market
for optics, 100 to 400 gigabits per second.

0:29:50.799,0:30:00.030
But we recognize that things have changed.
There are geopolitical issues. There is likely

0:30:00.030,0:30:08.500
to be more and more constraints – and high-end
in AI and AI solutions, and so we intend to

0:30:08.500,0:30:17.390
create an alternate joint venture outside
of China and follow what we would call a “China

0:30:17.390,0:30:23.820
plus one” strategy, which a lot of customers
require or demand, where we have a foot in

0:30:23.820,0:30:30.640
china to support kind of the Chinese market
with China components, and then we have kind

0:30:30.640,0:30:37.210
of the ability to be able to manufacture outside
of China as well. So we're actively seeking

0:30:37.210,0:30:43.850
as i said an additional JV partner to provide
a source of independent financing for this.

0:30:43.850,0:30:49.029
This is critical to POET's future. And we
believe we can be very, very successful in

0:30:49.029,0:31:08.000
this endeavor. I'm sorry, my ability to move
the slides is somewhat delayed. We've done

0:31:08.000,0:31:15.149
a fair bit on the investor outreach front.
Our goal was to increase awareness

0:31:15.149,0:31:24.159
of POET, so audience is likely to invest, with
a focus on the U.S. We've taken various steps

0:31:24.159,0:31:32.539
to do that, some popular, some not so popular,
but the results speak for themselves. We've

0:31:32.539,0:31:41.380
had a 300 percent growth in monthly website visits
from December to June – a 100 percent month

0:31:41.380,0:31:49.059
over month visit growth from May. 3:1 U.S. visitors
to canadian visitors, which was a big thing.

0:31:49.059,0:31:57.929
We wanted to get more presence in the
U.S. Our Nasdaq volumes are finally higher than

0:31:57.929,0:32:05.669
TSX venture and has been up since December.
So we will continue to attack and adapt, of

0:32:05.669,0:32:11.210
course. Not everything that we do
works beautifully. We have a path, we have a

0:32:11.210,0:32:15.429
vision, we want to get something done, but, 
as with everything else, you have to attack

0:32:15.429,0:32:22.850
and adapt, and we are. But the results speak
for themselves and we will continue to drive

0:32:22.850,0:32:34.220
this, going forward. 
So, in summary, we've created an innovative

0:32:34.220,0:32:39.669
patented optoelectronic integration platform
technology. We believe we're the only known

0:32:39.669,0:32:47.960
technology that can meet the vectors of volume,
size, cost, power, for future photonics products,

0:32:47.960,0:32:57.419
especially in large, high-growth markets, including
datacom, telecom, and AI hardware. We are partnered

0:32:57.419,0:33:02.750
with some of the leading companies in the
optical communications supply chain. We're

0:33:02.750,0:33:10.820
engaged with several key customers now. That
allows us to demonstrate the technical acceptance

0:33:10.820,0:33:17.450
of our solution. I mean, we are, after all, doing
something that has not been done before. We

0:33:17.450,0:33:22.820
are, after all, creating products are that are
first of its kind in the industry and there's

0:33:22.820,0:33:29.440
some degree of healthy skepticism about whether
we can actually do it and that's skepticism

0:33:29.440,0:33:36.000
first is can it be done technically then it's
can it actually meet specs and then it's can

0:33:36.000,0:33:44.610
you actually scale this in volume and we're
going through that process super photonics

0:33:44.610,0:33:49.740
is critical to enable market acceptance of
our optical engine products we're doing that

0:33:49.740,0:33:58.200
today they're ramping up we have a revenue
pipeline on customer engagements that provide

0:33:58.200,0:34:03.690
150 million dollars of three-year estimated
revenues based on their projections to us

0:34:03.690,0:34:11.300
of course there's no guarantees but you know
they know their business they know their customers

0:34:11.300,0:34:20.750
and they believe that they can represent us
what it would mean to us with this engagement

0:34:20.750,0:34:26.659
we expect revenue to begin in 2024 but of
course we will have production orders this

0:34:26.659,0:34:33.929
year we already do for the first half of next
year three million dollars from the fyy we

0:34:33.929,0:34:38.889
expect pos this year as well in fact super
photonics does have evos but like i said these

0:34:38.889,0:34:47.399
are quantities that enable our customers to
design their modules in although our engines

0:34:47.399,0:34:52.330
are ready you know we can't ramp into production
until our customer or so in this case super

0:34:52.330,0:34:59.079
photonics this customer can ramp their solution
and in some cases there have been some delays

0:34:59.079,0:35:03.000
because they have never used optical engines
before and so it's a learning process for

0:35:03.000,0:35:08.230
them as well so we kind of go through that
i mean it's you know there there are changes

0:35:08.230,0:35:12.880
and and to our roadmap sometimes out of our
control you know our products are ready and

0:35:12.880,0:35:17.369
available and sampling and providing to the
customers and then we just have to work through

0:35:17.369,0:35:21.650
the process of getting them designed in and
i think we're the likes at the end of the

0:35:21.650,0:35:26.480
tunnel we can see it we've we work with these
customers and and we do believe over the next

0:35:26.480,0:35:31.930
couple of quarters that um that we should
or super photonics should be able to start

0:35:31.930,0:35:40.829
start their ramp right and most significantly
we've created a significant value capture

0:35:40.829,0:35:45.740
potential with super photonics in terms of
its asset appreciation and what that can mean

0:35:45.740,0:35:52.230
to poet in terms of non-diluted financing
the company we need it right we need the financing

0:35:52.230,0:35:59.260
to be able to keep our roadmap to drive our
leadership in a sense in the ai space to really

0:35:59.260,0:36:08.670
take advantage of our existing position and
grow it and and we think that this is a very

0:36:08.670,0:36:15.780
very critical piece of you know how how that
can happen in in the long term so with that

0:36:15.780,0:36:20.040
you know let me close and and i thank you
for your time i thank you for your attention

0:36:20.040,0:36:35.400
i thank you for your support go put i hand
it over to you at this point all right i'll

0:36:35.400,0:36:44.900
jump in i think uh suresh with some questions
uh from uh from the from the group at uh gopode

0:36:44.900,0:36:51.690
indeed uh tell us what your objectives were
with the atm or aftermarket financing that

0:36:51.690,0:37:08.089
was announced this morning oh sorry um i think
i was i might have met him been on mute uh

0:37:08.089,0:37:13.230
can you repeat that because it just didn't
come through clearly on my end sure uh tell

0:37:13.230,0:37:18.829
us what your objectives were with the atm
or the at the market financing that was announced

0:37:18.829,0:37:26.710
this morning oh yeah the the atm or at the
market program you know it gives port management

0:37:26.710,0:37:31.520
the flexibility to raise capital in small
amounts over the course of the next year um

0:37:31.520,0:37:39.589
i think there's uh a lot of misunderstandings
um associated with the mechanics of how atm

0:37:39.589,0:37:46.460
works so i will shortly kind of ask tom to
maybe step in and and paint some color and

0:37:46.460,0:37:54.000
and provide some some guidance there um but
as as the atm itself it's the least costly

0:37:54.000,0:37:58.740
method for the company to raise capital in
the public markets low commissions compared

0:37:58.740,0:38:06.660
to public offerings no warrants attached you're
basically selling shares at market price no

0:38:06.660,0:38:13.329
discounts so the atm programs have been common
among issues in the united states for several

0:38:13.329,0:38:20.810
years and have become much more popular now
recently in canada and we believe that an

0:38:20.810,0:38:28.790
atm is an essential part of a financing strategy
of a high growth technology-based company

0:38:28.790,0:38:36.420
but you know the mechanics of the atm is i
guess misunderstood and um so perhaps tom

0:38:36.420,0:38:44.569
you might want to take a few minutes to explain
how the mechanics work sure i'd be happy to

0:38:44.569,0:38:52.079
suresh thank you uh what i want to emphasize
first is is that this is not a 30 million

0:38:52.079,0:38:58.780
dollar financing that we're doing today or
any time in the in the near future it's very

0:38:58.780,0:39:07.420
much misunderstood as being that it's a facility
that allows us the company to sell shares

0:39:07.420,0:39:16.460
at the market price and we're it's a heavily
regulated transaction so we're we have to

0:39:16.460,0:39:24.420
be cautious about whether our intervention
or our sale of shares into that market moves

0:39:24.420,0:39:33.450
the market so we're intending over the course
of the next 12 months to take advantage of

0:39:33.450,0:39:41.780
high volume days in which we believe we can
sell co-chairs at a reasonable and appropriate

0:39:41.780,0:39:48.720
price and the way that that happens is the
there were two investment banks uh that were

0:39:48.720,0:39:54.800
named in the prospectus one is craig hallam
in the united states who many of you know

0:39:54.800,0:40:05.630
uh follows us through richard shannon uh their
analysts in the optics area and in canada

0:40:05.630,0:40:12.170
core mark that has been an investment bank
for us for a couple of transactions few transactions

0:40:12.170,0:40:20.060
over the past couple of years so i have access
to a particular trader at each of those desks

0:40:20.060,0:40:29.410
and we convene early in the morning and see
what the market activity is going to be project

0:40:29.410,0:40:36.770
what we think the market activity may be during
the week and we determine at that time whether

0:40:36.770,0:40:42.710
or not we're going to be selling any shares
into the market we are totally in control

0:40:42.710,0:40:51.440
of the price at which we sell shares and the
number of shares that we sell and so having

0:40:51.440,0:40:57.820
that kind of facility around allows us to
raise capital in the public market as suresh

0:40:57.820,0:41:04.930
said at the lowest cost it's a three percent
commission rather than a seven percent commission

0:41:04.930,0:41:11.710
and there are no warrants and it's at the
market so we're not really you know competing

0:41:11.710,0:41:19.480
against um others to to who want to buy or
sell our shares so it's important to remember

0:41:19.480,0:41:25.670
that this is a facility that we have that
will completely in control of it's been very

0:41:25.670,0:41:32.430
common as suresh said in the united states
for a long time among most issuers and in

0:41:32.430,0:41:37.460
canada because they've relaxed the rules somewhat
over the last two years it's becoming more

0:41:37.460,0:41:44.610
common and i think you'll see it in many other
issuers uh up in canada so we're going to

0:41:44.610,0:41:52.170
be we're going to be looking at both markets
over time and as i said we're um we have to

0:41:52.170,0:41:57.770
be very cautious about not moving the market
in any way and i'm sure that the regulators

0:41:57.770,0:42:06.420
will be watching that over the course of the
next 12 months um okay so thank you thanks

0:42:06.420,0:42:12.560
uh tom thanks uh suresh on on giving us some
background on that uh following on the same

0:42:12.560,0:42:18.170
topic how does the company plan to fund itself
for the next six to 12 months while ramping

0:42:18.170,0:42:23.400
production and does the company need or plan
to raise additional capital before the end

0:42:23.400,0:42:31.950
of 2023 beyond what you've already mentioned
yeah i put current stage we're continuously

0:42:31.950,0:42:37.589
evaluating the capital required to operate
the business and execute on our ongoing strategic

0:42:37.589,0:42:44.950
initiatives um as part of this process we're
actively considering several potential alternatives

0:42:44.950,0:42:51.069
non-dilutive means of bringing in additional
capital as mentioned in the presentation we

0:42:51.069,0:42:56.420
believe that our equity in spx is a valuable
asset that is not obvious in our financial

0:42:56.420,0:43:02.220
statements and we have been approached by
private equity companies interested in owning

0:43:02.220,0:43:10.460
a piece of that operation which both jv partners
believe is a good prospect for an ipo in china

0:43:10.460,0:43:16.390
so once spx begins to generate revenue we
expect its value to increase exponentially

0:43:16.390,0:43:21.590
in addition in connection with our plan to
sell modules we believe that there are good

0:43:21.590,0:43:28.590
opportunities to form additional joint ventures
um if you were to create a new jv for module

0:43:28.590,0:43:35.310
production we would expect to structure it
uh in a way to both provide capital to pull

0:43:35.310,0:43:45.910
it and also to allow us to consolidate its
results in our financial statements okay and

0:43:45.910,0:43:53.809
um moving on to a question on some of our
early adopters our early customers uh when

0:43:53.809,0:43:59.630
uh when do we expect to be in production or
have receive initial orders from adva and

0:43:59.630,0:44:07.150
fiber top for some of the poet legacy that
um they're contracting as i said i mean you

0:44:07.150,0:44:12.680
know i think initial orders we've had it we've
delivered it that cx has rather um you know

0:44:12.680,0:44:18.410
i think the the key thing is you know how
quickly can they complete their module design

0:44:18.410,0:44:24.980
and um and it's gone through some iterations
um you know these are these are companies

0:44:24.980,0:44:31.510
i mean not used to working with optical engines
in the case of our advert it's it's uh i mean

0:44:31.510,0:44:37.280
like i said 16 channels in a case of pdd never
been done before um so they're going through

0:44:37.280,0:44:43.369
some learning curves on their end right our
designs are complete the products ready um

0:44:43.369,0:44:48.160
but we believe they're closed and and they
do have an end market that they can sell them

0:44:48.160,0:44:52.710
to their customers are waiting so there's
motivational and best of interest of the part

0:44:52.710,0:44:58.770
of them to finish their module design we expect
that this happens over the course of this

0:44:58.770,0:45:05.430
quarter uh honestly um i think now that we
have the ability to travel to china and i

0:45:05.430,0:45:10.530
believe roger is there next week you know
we're going to be able to get much better

0:45:10.530,0:45:15.390
engagement with them and you know hasten their
development in the case of fiber top for example

0:45:15.390,0:45:21.640
but but i mean they're engaged we've got weekly
meetings um it's hard to project and predict

0:45:21.640,0:45:26.089
exactly when they're gonna rank you know i
mean this is this has been our challenge as

0:45:26.089,0:45:32.760
well and that you know our products ready
uh we will release it at the end of this coming

0:45:32.760,0:45:37.430
quarter and kill three but does that mean
it ramps immediately probably not but it's

0:45:37.430,0:45:44.970
not very far and and for sure it's not a question
of if and when but but rather when the opportunity

0:45:44.970,0:45:52.660
is there the value potential is there um we
just need to we need our customer in a sense

0:45:52.660,0:45:59.480
um to begin their ramp which which we do expect
uh to happen in 24 with like i said initial

0:45:59.480,0:46:04.360
production will start at the end of this year
but but really the the meaningful production

0:46:04.360,0:46:11.359
will be in 2024. um but that's you know largely
given their schedule right i mean it's it's

0:46:11.359,0:46:17.670
it's hard for us to kind of really push that
on on our end uh aggressively i think the

0:46:17.670,0:46:22.700
best we can do is to release the product and
have it available and you know work with them

0:46:22.700,0:46:29.120
closely which is what the team's doing um
to enable their design to be completed okay

0:46:29.120,0:46:34.670
terrific uh on to a couple of questions or
back to the stock price as a topic uh two

0:46:34.670,0:46:40.740
questions on that what strategy is being employed
to attract new institutional investors and

0:46:40.740,0:46:48.710
what gives you the confidence it will be effective
look i mean over the past 18 months i think

0:46:48.710,0:46:55.599
it's yeah about about the time we kind of
moved to the nasdaq um or about the time russia

0:46:55.599,0:47:00.030
in the end of ukraine whichever way you look
at it um we have participated in nine wall

0:47:00.030,0:47:09.331
street focused conferences targeted at institutional
retail investors in the us we have we remain

0:47:09.331,0:47:14.260
engaged with and distribute all announced
business developments with a sizable number

0:47:14.260,0:47:20.640
of institutional investor targets which are
continuing to follow poet's progress we've

0:47:20.640,0:47:26.700
also stayed actively engaged with multiple
south side research analysts including our

0:47:26.700,0:47:32.610
existing covering analysts such as richard
richard shannon at greg hallo who initiated

0:47:32.610,0:47:38.900
last year and has continued to provide forward
with much broader exposure is highly recognized

0:47:38.900,0:47:45.109
in the industry he covers momentum and some
of the larger companies right so he knows

0:47:45.109,0:47:51.670
what he's talking about and i think he's respected
and recognized additionally we have been driving

0:47:51.670,0:47:56.260
increased visibility through participation
and presentations and industry trade shows

0:47:56.260,0:48:06.920
i think just this week we had a a video that
was actually in chinese created by mo you

0:48:06.920,0:48:13.970
know that that got a lot of inbound traction
um when it was published at the industry trade

0:48:13.970,0:48:20.200
show there so this all contributes to elevated
awareness not just among customers but but

0:48:20.200,0:48:28.740
also tech oriented investors okay and what
else is the company doing to increase the

0:48:28.740,0:48:38.260
current uh share price look at shareholders
ourselves um we're always looking at new ways

0:48:38.260,0:48:42.970
to support our stock price and attract new
investors our top priority as a management

0:48:42.970,0:48:50.119
team is to create shareholder value through
continued execution on our business plan and

0:48:50.119,0:48:57.069
begin generating a sustainable and growing
revenue stream to the extent that we are successful

0:48:57.069,0:49:02.380
in capturing even a portion of the available
market opportunity we believe the stock price

0:49:02.380,0:49:09.950
will ultimately reflect that value appropriately
to help further expand our investor outreach

0:49:09.950,0:49:15.760
efforts in january we retain stockhouse to
help execute an advertising and marketing

0:49:15.760,0:49:22.400
campaign that has seen increased interest
through website visitation as well as expanded

0:49:22.400,0:49:29.380
awareness via newsletters and digital marketing
then in april we engaged he capital markets

0:49:29.380,0:49:36.270
for distribution of our company's content
on investors hub and wall street silver services

0:49:36.270,0:49:42.329
we also continue to actively participate in
wall street focused events conferences speaking

0:49:42.329,0:49:49.581
opportunities the one thing i'd like to point
out is that poetstalk is up what over 40 year

0:49:49.581,0:49:56.210
to date and even over the past 12 months we've
kind of meaningfully outperformed a large

0:49:56.210,0:50:02.010
majority of publicly traded micro cap tech
companies it's not been an easy market folks

0:50:02.010,0:50:11.569
um but you know there's there's still just
satisfaction obviously and um you know but

0:50:11.569,0:50:20.260
what we can do is is manage what is on our
control and that is execute our roadmap which

0:50:20.260,0:50:26.760
we've been doing and you've seen it you know
we've provided our roadmap and we periodically

0:50:26.760,0:50:33.180
give you updates and we're on track and what
do you think uh then suresh based on this

0:50:33.180,0:50:38.900
activity that poets valuation should be now
based on the progress that you've outlined

0:50:38.900,0:50:46.309
what we've made this year i i don't think
it's an it's it's my job to comment on on

0:50:46.309,0:50:55.160
valuations so i i don't think i'm going to
answer that question okay and let's uh let's

0:50:55.160,0:51:01.210
have one here on uh when can we expect to
see additional buying and or exercising of

0:51:01.210,0:51:13.720
warrants by insights look i mean i think most
of the warrants are are done there's probably

0:51:13.720,0:51:21.839
a single crunch of warrants left in august
um so yeah i mean i think uh you know i i

0:51:21.839,0:51:26.900
like like i said i don't i don't control what
other management members of the board do in

0:51:26.900,0:51:35.231
poet we're all independent um folks um so
yeah i i don't think there's uh a lot more

0:51:35.231,0:51:39.980
warrants left honestly to be exercised than
we we'd like to keep it that way going forward

0:51:39.980,0:51:46.760
too okay and and with the stock trading where
it is today how committed is management and

0:51:46.760,0:51:51.400
the board to resisting a potential unsolicited
buyer to offer at an attractive valuation

0:51:51.400,0:52:15.060
oh um and you know look uh our our interest
is is in building you know long-term shareholder

0:52:15.060,0:52:23.250
value and um and so you know i think we're
uh we recognize and understand the value we

0:52:23.250,0:52:32.150
bring and we recognize and understand the
value um that is achievable and so you know

0:52:32.150,0:52:37.990
i don't think this is a concern that existing
shareholders need to have i think you know

0:52:37.990,0:52:44.710
we all collectively are vested in doing what
is necessary to drive uh shareholder value

0:52:44.710,0:52:54.170
at valuations that we believe uh accurately
represents uh what we offer uh in the industry

0:52:54.170,0:53:04.390
right and what we offer to this large and
growing market uh especially in ai okay and

0:53:04.390,0:53:12.799
we have a question here um about uh competitors
both uh well let's go within nvidia are they're

0:53:12.799,0:53:23.420
currently the kings of the ai market how could
poet uh enhance their offering look i think

0:53:23.420,0:53:28.170
you know and i mean nvidia the kings and the
ai market because they create uh you know

0:53:28.170,0:53:33.210
highly parallel computing infrastructure with
their gpus and then you know they tie it up

0:53:33.210,0:53:41.920
with with large amounts of memory and and
sell these pgx boxes at 30 40 000 a pop um

0:53:41.920,0:53:47.089
but you know i think going forward i mean
you know i think data center servers are going

0:53:47.089,0:53:51.930
to incorporate in video graphics processors
and so on and so forth so yes they're they're

0:53:51.930,0:53:59.750
they're a graphics company there are kings
there um i think how poet helps is uh is by

0:53:59.750,0:54:06.480
providing you know the means to communicate
either between graphics and memory or by providing

0:54:06.480,0:54:12.930
the means to communicate between servers um
and you know today much of that is done either

0:54:12.930,0:54:19.220
by you know 800 gig and a transceiver modules
they look like transceiver modules but they're

0:54:19.220,0:54:26.540
kind of custom specifically for ai um or um
they can take the form of photonic fabrics

0:54:26.540,0:54:32.740
um and and other such uh applications that
there are other companies kind of driving

0:54:32.740,0:54:40.160
and so so the ai segment is kind of bifurcated
right one is there's just a growth or a need

0:54:40.160,0:54:47.650
for a lot of optics and that is bifurcated
into kind of transceiver like form factors

0:54:47.650,0:54:53.869
which we plan to and then into photonic fabric
like form factors with new companies and upcoming

0:54:53.869,0:55:00.590
companies that again we play into by providing
remote light sources so i think we're um we're

0:55:00.590,0:55:07.200
well covered uh in terms of what we can do
and um and are actively working to intercept

0:55:07.200,0:55:15.030
this very large growth market over the next
couple of years okay of the 11th current uh

0:55:15.030,0:55:20.510
contracted uh projects that you uh stated
uh having today which one or two represent

0:55:20.510,0:55:25.549
the largest near-term revenue opportunities
i guess this is specifically with our products

0:55:25.549,0:55:30.280
and our customers and what are the remaining
steps to convert these opportunities into

0:55:30.280,0:55:38.640
revenue well i mean i think for most part
these are committed projects i mean i think

0:55:38.640,0:55:43.819
we're going through the development phases
in the case of companies like celestial and

0:55:43.819,0:55:48.789
their projected volumes to us i mean you know
those are products that are committed and

0:55:48.789,0:55:55.490
we have pos we have to deliver all the teams
working on you know finishing up that design

0:55:55.490,0:56:00.200
by the end of this year and you know we have
a po to deliver a certain number of those

0:56:00.200,0:56:08.030
uh engines by by the end of 2024 for you know
kind of a larger ramp next year um turn most

0:56:08.030,0:56:14.040
of those except for one i believe uh which
is still um you know in evaluation by the

0:56:14.040,0:56:20.109
customer um there are commitments to use the
products they are designed in so then it's

0:56:20.109,0:56:26.450
it's not to me a question of if then it's
a question of when that when depends less

0:56:26.450,0:56:32.700
on poet's readiness and more on our customers
you know ability to convert that into a module

0:56:32.700,0:56:38.410
design and then ultimately take it and and
be successful in the market um but you know

0:56:38.410,0:56:45.109
on a balance you know i think we're well positioned
there with with a really good potential okay

0:56:45.109,0:56:55.760
and uh regarding air labs do you view them
as a competitor or a potential partner neither

0:56:55.760,0:57:02.000
i view them as a as a customer a potential
customer um i mean they they are one of the

0:57:02.000,0:57:08.549
companies that have a photonics fabric um
they also require a remote light source and

0:57:08.549,0:57:14.880
we believe we have a good technical solution
um and uh there have been dialogues and discussions

0:57:14.880,0:57:21.319
and we hope at some point that we can convert
that opportunity into into you know a real

0:57:21.319,0:57:30.380
engagement uh and with uh uh sticking with
the products and uh the uh optical interposer

0:57:30.380,0:57:39.680
how far behind are competitors to what the
optical interposer can do i'm sorry i think

0:57:39.680,0:57:45.599
you have to repeat that question please how
far behind are the competitors to uh the optical

0:57:45.599,0:57:52.900
interposer and what it's able to deliver to
the market look i mean i have yet to see i

0:57:52.900,0:57:57.700
mean i've said this publicly before i think
the only company that had you know capability

0:57:57.700,0:58:04.850
uh or at least a vision are very similar to
what poet was discussing and talking about

0:58:04.850,0:58:12.539
was rock lee photonics um you know they ultimately
were not successful in creating these products

0:58:12.539,0:58:18.999
and data communications i mean we've we've
successfully sampled 800 gig receivers because

0:58:18.999,0:58:24.530
it's i mean you know we we we've done we've
come a long ways relative to what others thought

0:58:24.530,0:58:30.510
they could do but couldn't ultimately do it
um now outside of them i'm not seeing too

0:58:30.510,0:58:41.510
many single things sorry uh no that's good
that's uh uh regarding the light bar have

0:58:41.510,0:58:48.290
other companies tested the light bar family
products and how are those samples um being

0:58:48.290,0:58:58.830
received and can we expect future announcements
there's a little bit of i mean ambiguity among

0:58:58.830,0:59:05.789
the customer base especially as it relates
to copaceted optics or um or remote blazers

0:59:05.789,0:59:13.400
um it is a very very custom market it's a
kind of a wild west right now there's no there's

0:59:13.400,0:59:18.539
no kind of standards um you know what our
labs uses is something completely different

0:59:18.539,0:59:22.450
what celestial wants is something completely
different what light matter uses something

0:59:22.450,0:59:28.049
completely different like the legends is completely
different they're all different right and

0:59:28.049,0:59:33.230
so what you know um in in a sense it plays
to our strength because we've got a platform

0:59:33.230,0:59:39.359
we have the ability to adopt these solutions
um but you know it's also difficult because

0:59:39.359,0:59:44.530
we keep sampling and talking to customers
and they change their requirements and needs

0:59:44.530,0:59:50.020
sometimes it's four channels it grows to eight
and it's 12 and um so yeah i think you know

0:59:50.020,0:59:54.150
well the good thing is we've got the right
products and we've got the relationships and

0:59:54.150,1:00:00.380
the engagement uh and we do believe that you
know as those requirements and needs develop

1:00:00.380,1:00:06.750
and coalesce into something uh we will have
the solutions available for them um but um

1:00:06.750,1:00:13.240
today our primary focus is you know ensure
a successful deployment on celestial ai i

1:00:13.240,1:00:19.319
mean honestly uh if they are half as successful
as they think they're going to be and have

1:00:19.319,1:00:26.380
represented in their uh forecast that i'm
sure you can read up um you can see how lucrative

1:00:26.380,1:00:31.500
just simply that is going to be for this company
um and then you add one or two i think the

1:00:31.500,1:00:37.720
intent is really not to go we're not here
trying to get numbers in terms of customers

1:00:37.720,1:00:45.700
we're trying to get wins win with the winners
right and and and we think if we can you know

1:00:45.700,1:00:51.330
just convert a couple of them um these are
really really large opportunities ahead of

1:00:51.330,1:00:58.710
us and i've got one here on uh that's i know
the the team is excited about the this application

1:00:58.710,1:01:08.869
with film thin film lithium nibate uh can
you comment on on that and how's that progressing

1:01:08.869,1:01:14.329
future you know the important thing is that
we have the ability to to incorporate new

1:01:14.329,1:01:20.690
and upcoming components onto our interposer
uh but look i mean you know 10 from lithium

1:01:20.690,1:01:25.480
live here is not going to be ready for prime
time in terms of kind of commercial volumes

1:01:25.480,1:01:31.650
for it for it's at least three years um so
you know i think it's it's it's something

1:01:31.650,1:01:39.299
that we're engaged with in this case you know
um liabate on and and we're working with them

1:01:39.299,1:01:44.890
in parallel but you know we've also got a
focus on products that you know we know are

1:01:44.890,1:01:51.200
imminently required um so we are you know
initiating our development programs around

1:01:51.200,1:01:58.500
a 200 gig per lane eml based solutions that
those are the most mature solutions for 200

1:01:58.500,1:02:05.359
gigabit per lane today um lithium-908 will
be there at some point but you know i think

1:02:05.359,1:02:11.039
we we need to we need to work with components
that are ready today um and and leverage them

1:02:11.039,1:02:17.609
fast and rapidly you know and not keep betting
the form on some future um i think we made

1:02:17.609,1:02:23.470
that mistake a year and a half ago with so
you know waiting for a silicon photonics modulator

1:02:23.470,1:02:27.500
to be available and we lost a year on our
roadmap and i don't think we're ready to make

1:02:27.500,1:02:35.039
that mistake again uh no certainly not and
lots lots going on with with the company and

1:02:35.039,1:02:38.809
that i don't see any more questions uh ceresha
i'm just going to throw it back to you for

1:02:38.809,1:02:48.460
some closing remarks yeah well i mean you
know it's uh it's been a it's been a an exciting

1:02:48.460,1:02:54.920
year so far um you know we've we've got a
lot of work ahead of us for sure um you know

1:02:54.920,1:03:03.839
we've had shareholders um that have either
express good satisfaction or dissatisfaction

1:03:03.839,1:03:11.470
and i'm hoping that we can all coalition around
the fact that you know we over the past five

1:03:11.470,1:03:18.980
years have developed something that is new
that is unique um you know we're committed

1:03:18.980,1:03:28.960
as a team to drive progress we're committed
as a team to ensure success um and and we

1:03:28.960,1:03:35.810
do believe that you know um we've got as a
company the the the products to be able to

1:03:35.810,1:03:43.680
leverage this um you know new and rapidly
growing area of ai which is going to provide

1:03:43.680,1:03:50.319
tremendous opportunity to everybody in photonics
uh including poet right and and so and you

1:03:50.319,1:03:54.809
know the good thing is we're well positioned
to capitalize on it because it kind of plays

1:03:54.809,1:04:01.400
to our strengths um so i'm i'm kind of stoked
about that looking forward to the future uh

1:04:01.400,1:04:13.461
and as always thank you for your continued
support very good uh thank you suresh i really

1:04:13.461,1:04:19.839

to you for your continued support and we look
forward to joining with you again at future

1:04:47.960,1:04:54.190
meetings please have yourselves a good safe
and enjoyable canada day long weekend and

1:04:54.190,1:04:56.338
july 4th long weekend thank you all I am Dr.
Suresh Venkatesan. I’m the chairman and

1:04:56.338,1:04:57.338
CEO of POET Technologies and I want to provide
you with a short update on on the company

1:04:57.338,1:04:58.338
and what we’ve achieved over the past year.
Let'’s see if I can get this working. Have

1:04:58.338,1:04:59.338
you used ChatGPT lately? Questions like this
signal the increasing presence of AI in our

1:04:59.338,1:05:00.338
tech-heavy world. AI, generative AI, artificial
intelligence is all the rage these days. Do

1:05:00.338,1:05:01.338
you know what the biggest challenge with AI
is today? It’s power, energy! I was at a

1:05:01.338,1:05:02.338
conference on this topic the other day. Apparently
the power required to program the 175 billion

1:05:02.338,1:05:03.338
parameters in ChatGPT runs over a gigawatt!
Just by contrast: The human brain consumes

1:05:03.338,1:05:04.338
25 watts of power for similar operations.
That is quite a chasm to cross! But one way

1:05:04.338,1:05:05.338
to begin to address the power challenge is
to convert data transmission to optics, data

1:05:05.338,1:05:06.338
communications over optical fiber, using light
as the carrier dominates, because it is 10

1:05:06.338,1:05:07.338
times faster, uses 10 times less power and
produces much less heat than electrons flowing

1:05:07.338,1:05:08.338
through copper. Nothing else can do what photonics
can do to increase bandwidth and speed while

1:05:08.338,1:05:09.338
reducing latency and power consumption. So
what does POET do? POET makes optical modules

1:05:09.338,1:05:10.338
that enable optical data transmission. And
this is fundamental to scaling the presence

1:05:10.338,1:05:11.338
of AI. Others make optical modules as well.
But POET has developed unique intellectual

1:05:11.338,1:05:12.338
property that allows us to make these modules
better, cheaper, lower power and larger scale

1:05:12.338,1:05:13.338
than anyone else. More than cost or bill of
sales it is the scale where POET shines. And

1:05:13.338,1:05:14.338
by scale we mean the number of units that
can be economically produced. POET has semiconductorized

1:05:14.338,1:05:15.338
photonics packaging and put it squarely on
the same trajectory as semiconductors. Semiconductorization

1:05:15.338,1:05:16.338
of photonics using POET’s proprietary Optical
Interposer provides unprecedented scale and

1:05:16.338,1:05:17.338
economy for the rapidly growing AI and optical
communications market. In fact it's our belief

1:05:17.338,1:05:18.338
that it's not possible to address these markets
that need hundreds of millions or billions

1:05:18.338,1:05:19.338
of these devices any other way. Integration
is the key. Semiconductorization is the key.

1:05:19.338,1:05:20.338
And we believe we have pioneered this art
of semiconductorization of photonics packaging.

1:05:20.338,1:05:21.338
And that means terrific potential in a large
growing and increasingly relevant market in

1:05:21.338,1:05:22.338
AI and co-packaged optics. We have come a
long way over the past year with many accomplishments

1:05:22.338,1:05:23.338
under our belt. We serve a very large market
worth billions of dollars, particularly in

1:05:23.338,1:05:24.338
data communications and AI. We're squarely
in the supply chain for AI hardware. We have

1:05:24.338,1:05:25.338
a super unique and patented technology that
provides us with a source of sustained competitive

1:05:25.338,1:05:26.338
differentiation across a number of market
verticals including AI and high performance

1:05:26.338,1:05:27.338
computing. We have an exciting product roadmap,
born out of six years of technology and product

1:05:27.338,1:05:28.338
development. We've partnered with some of
the largest optical companies in the world,

1:05:28.338,1:05:29.338
like Lumentum, Broadcom, Macom. We have a
pipeline of customers across the world and

1:05:29.338,1:05:30.338
design wins that could total more than 150
million dollars of revenue over a three-year

1:05:30.338,1:05:31.338
period. We have a majority stake in a manufacturing
joint venture that could alone have an asset

1:05:31.338,1:05:32.338
value of over 200 million over the next two
to three years. The prime motivator for optics

1:05:32.338,1:05:33.338
and data communications and AI is power and
latency. Light as we have mentioned is 10x

1:05:33.338,1:05:34.338
faster and 10x lower power and has ruled the
roost when it comes to long distance data

1:05:34.338,1:05:35.338
communications. In fact, photonics 1.0 was
driven by submarine communications, long-distance

1:05:35.338,1:05:36.338
communications; use optics as the medium for
that communication to occur. However, as bandwidth

1:05:36.338,1:05:37.338
– meaning the amount of information that
is communicated per second – keeps increasing,

1:05:37.338,1:05:38.338
the distance over which this data is communicated
with light has become shorter and shorter.

1:05:38.338,1:05:39.338
Photonics 2.0, data centers, key driver for
optics. So optics is now in data centers,

1:05:39.338,1:05:40.338
is used for communications when distances
exceed about five meters. With AI, the bandwidth

1:05:40.338,1:05:41.338
and power crunch is so severe that there is
now a need to utilize optics as a means to

1:05:41.338,1:05:42.338
communicate data even between individual components,
like graphics and memory. The volume and scale

1:05:42.338,1:05:43.338
of these AI applications quickly trumps the
more conventional data center applications.

1:05:43.338,1:05:44.338
And the greater the need, the greater we feel
POET’s solutions in the space will begin

1:05:44.338,1:05:45.338
to gain favor. AI is the killer app for photonics
3.0. So the market for POET solutions spans

1:05:45.338,1:05:46.338
the more traditional data centers and data
communications which includes of course enterprise

1:05:46.338,1:05:47.338
and telecom applications and the new and emerging
market around AI-driven needs for optics.

1:05:47.338,1:05:48.338
In fact, we believe the AI-driven needs are
going to trump the more conventional data

1:05:48.338,1:05:49.338
center interconnects that has really been
kind of the prime driver for the past decade.

1:05:49.338,1:05:50.338
Both of these markets are large and growing.
They exceed 12 billion dollars in TAM by 2025.

1:05:50.338,1:05:51.338
The inflection point for growth in these markets
begins next year, and POET is well poised

1:05:51.338,1:05:52.338
with both solutions and customer access this
year. And we are well-positioned to intercept

1:05:52.338,1:05:53.338
this market at the right time with our differentiated
solutions. So the key challenges in photonics,

1:05:53.338,1:05:54.338
especially when it comes to very large scale
in terms of volume, is really the ability

1:05:54.338,1:05:55.338
to build millions, billions of these devices
and conventional photonics packaging technology

1:05:55.338,1:05:56.338
simply will not fit the bill. I mean, those
solutions have been designed and have been

1:05:56.338,1:05:57.338
developed and honed over 30 years. But they
were first designed for single-channel applications.

1:05:57.338,1:05:58.338
Then they were designed for quad applications,
where the base technology was scaled through

1:05:58.338,1:05:59.338
engineering. But today the applications demand
eight channels, 16 channels. They demand hundreds

1:05:59.338,1:06:00.338
of millions of units a year, not millions
of units a year. And there comes a point where

1:06:00.338,1:06:01.338
these conventional technologies simply cannot
fit the bill. Absolutely possible to engineer

1:06:01.338,1:06:02.338
in prototype quantities. But try to scale
that with good economy! Economies and economics

1:06:02.338,1:06:03.338
– that's where POET comes in. Our vision
has always been wafer-scale integration of

1:06:03.338,1:06:04.338
known-good-die components that address the
pinch points of volume, size, cost, power

1:06:04.338,1:06:05.338
consumption. These are the areas where we
believe our technology ticks the boxes – consistently.

1:06:05.338,1:06:06.338
And that is the beauty of what POET has invented,
which is the Optical Interposer. The Optical

1:06:06.338,1:06:07.338
Interposer enables what we call chip-scale,
wafer-level packaging. In the world today

1:06:07.338,1:06:08.338
in semiconductors, wafer-level, chip-scale
packaging is the norm. You look at your cell

1:06:08.338,1:06:09.338
phone, you look at these devices that are
in high-performance computing. They're are

1:06:09.338,1:06:10.338
all built with wafer-level, chip-scale packaging,
where discrete electronics die are put together

1:06:10.338,1:06:11.338
into a chip-scale package. TSMC would call
that CoWoS, Intel calls it EMIB, but basically

1:06:11.338,1:06:12.338
it's a wafer-level, chip-scale packaging.
We're the first company in the world to adapt

1:06:12.338,1:06:13.338
wafer-level, chip-scale packaging to photonics.
So, now, instead of just integrating electronics

1:06:13.338,1:06:14.338
die, we're able to mix and match photonics
and electronics die on a wafer-scale packaging

1:06:14.338,1:06:15.338
platform. That's what we call the POET Optical
Interposer, and we've been successfully deploying

1:06:15.338,1:06:16.338
these interposer-based solutions into a number
of products, after basically having developed

1:06:16.338,1:06:17.338
the platform initially. The benefits to customers
are of course in cost, size, scale, and power

1:06:17.338,1:06:18.338
consumption. We believe, especially as you
go forward in high-frequency data communications,

1:06:18.338,1:06:19.338
the RF performance benefits. Often Optical
Interposer result ultimately in lower power

1:06:19.338,1:06:20.338
consumption. Of course there's the big conversion
of copper to optics, and that is a big piece

1:06:20.338,1:06:21.338
of that too. More importantly, with the Optical
Interposer is that our customers who adopt

1:06:21.338,1:06:22.338
interposer-based engine solutions can lower
their CapEx bill by by a factor of 10 because

1:06:22.338,1:06:23.338
we do all the integration onto the optical
engine. That is kind of cut both ways for

1:06:23.338,1:06:24.338
us. On the one hand, new and upcoming module
makers that have not invested in that CapEx

1:06:24.338,1:06:25.338
really love it because they take advantage
of this huge reduction in capex from their

1:06:25.338,1:06:26.338
perspective to adopt our solutions but on
the flip side you know bigger larger well-established

1:06:26.338,1:06:27.338
module makers that have already invested in
warehouses of capital and warehouses of people

1:06:27.338,1:06:28.338
um it's a little bit more difficult for them
to switch right and continue and adopt a solution

1:06:28.338,1:06:29.338
that largely eliminates a lot of their value
which is putting it together by buying an

1:06:29.338,1:06:30.338
integrated solution from poet so so that has
cut us both ways i mean it's it's it's learning

1:06:30.338,1:06:31.338
for us as we go forward you know in our progress
right uh but i think what is clear is is the

1:06:31.338,1:06:32.338
value proposition that the technology has
overall um and that's the platform the technology

1:06:32.338,1:06:33.338
that we've developed which also provides versatility
uh for a number of multiple applications from

1:06:33.338,1:06:34.338
a manufacturing standpoint um we've established
a joint venture we worked with china and i

1:06:34.338,1:06:35.338
see in 2019 um it was important for poet to
ensure that there was a high volume manufacturing

1:06:35.338,1:06:36.338
path for its optical engine solutions as a
small company we leveraged other people's

1:06:36.338,1:06:37.338
money in this context we created a joint venture
poor did not has not invested a dime in creating

1:06:37.338,1:06:38.338
this joint venture manufacturing capability
not a dime we've provided know-how no ip and

1:06:38.338,1:06:39.338
we've leveraged that know-how to create a
manufacturing asset a clean room equipment

1:06:39.338,1:06:40.338
people that's what's required to ultimately
scale up the technology and as a small company

1:06:40.338,1:06:41.338
we've been able to leverage sina and sana
is the world's largest provider of compound

1:06:41.338,1:06:42.338
semiconductors in terms of leds they recently
launched a 3.2 billion dollar joint venture

1:06:42.338,1:06:43.338
with sd microelectronics to do silicon carbide
chips i mean these guys know manufacturing

1:06:43.338,1:06:44.338
and and they want you know this joint venture
to be successful and they've been investing

1:06:44.338,1:06:45.338
into it this joint venture now takes our optical
interposers and converts them into optical

1:06:45.338,1:06:46.338
engines through wafer level assembly techniques
and these optical engines are then sold the

1:06:46.338,1:06:47.338
optical module makers and in some cases back
to port where poet makes the end module a

1:06:47.338,1:06:48.338
word on super photonics it's it's it's a latent
value that we have created in this company

1:06:48.338,1:06:49.338
that we believe doesn't get enough recognition
for what we've been able to deliver uh there

1:06:49.338,1:06:50.338
was a joint venture we formed in 2020 uh between
poet and sinai c just as covet was breaking

1:06:50.338,1:06:51.338
out the submission is to assemble best package
and sell optical engines is completely on

1:06:51.338,1:06:52.338
poet's optical interposal technology we formed
the company in 2019 the chinese company it

1:06:52.338,1:06:53.338
was independently valued at 50 million us
dollars at formation for poet it enables a

1:06:53.338,1:06:54.338
fab light manufacturing model with no investment
by part i mean we spent all our cash on r

1:06:54.338,1:06:55.338
d somebody else is enabling us to scale it
into manufacturing if four of them ourselves

1:06:55.338,1:06:56.338
we had to set up that manufacturing entity
we would have had to raise so much more money

1:06:56.338,1:06:57.338
to be able to create this capability but we
didn't we created a joint venture we got a

1:06:57.338,1:06:58.338
partner involved and they have now invested
10 million dollars and change they're committed

1:06:58.338,1:06:59.338
to investing another 15 million dollars to
scale this up over the next six months we've

1:06:59.338,1:07:00.338
employed 38 employees they've been able to
take our technology prototypes that we've

1:07:00.338,1:07:01.338
developed in singapore and demonstrate scale
and yield and and capability that that it's

1:07:01.338,1:07:02.338
truly impressive in fact i was there uh what
six weeks ago first time ever uh since we

1:07:02.338,1:07:03.338
formed the joint venture um as as china has
now opened up and and we're able to travel

1:07:03.338,1:07:04.338
freely with our old visas terrific stuff the
goal for the super photonics joint venture

1:07:04.338,1:07:05.338
is the ipo in china in 2026 2027. uh we currently
own a 80 equity stake in this joint venture

1:07:05.338,1:07:06.338
at the time of ipo we would probably be closer
to 50 percent even today there is strong interest

1:07:06.338,1:07:07.338
from china-based pe firms and owning a piece
of super photonics and valuations for photonics

1:07:07.338,1:07:08.338
in china are huge valuations for photonics
in china for innovative technologies even

1:07:08.338,1:07:09.338
bigger and once that innovative technology
starts turning revenue that valuation skyrocket

1:07:09.338,1:07:10.338
we believe that this joint venture could be
worth 200 over 200 million dollars in the

1:07:10.338,1:07:11.338
next couple to three years as soon as super
photonics start generating revenue insignificant

1:07:11.338,1:07:12.338
in an amount which we think will be in a couple
of years i mean that is just absolute latent

1:07:12.338,1:07:13.338
value that we have created and our ability
to capture that value is to be able to sell

1:07:13.338,1:07:14.338
our equity stake in that joint venture that
provides a non-dilutive source of financing

1:07:14.338,1:07:15.338
for the company to do other things more r
d more products so we think that you know

1:07:15.338,1:07:16.338
we're sitting on um on on really great value
and you know i commend the vacant team uh

1:07:16.338,1:07:17.338
for their efforts and being able to set this
up and and and and for the the overall poet

1:07:17.338,1:07:18.338
organization to support creating what we believe
is a very high value um capability for the

1:07:18.338,1:07:19.338
company going forward our line of optical
engines i mean this is what they look like

1:07:19.338,1:07:20.338
uh if you guys have seen semiconductor chips
you will know what i'm talking about these

1:07:20.338,1:07:21.338
are photonics sub-assemblies they look like
semiconductor chips on the left or our 800

1:07:21.338,1:07:22.338
gig receivers as well as transmitters we announced
just two weeks ago that we are starting to

1:07:22.338,1:07:23.338
sample our alphas of a 400 800 gig scalable
transmitter first of the kind in the industry

1:07:23.338,1:07:24.338
first company to use dml lasers and generate
400 gig 800 gig capability in fact when we

1:07:24.338,1:07:25.338
presented the data to momentum they acknowledged
that we're the first company that they have

1:07:25.338,1:07:26.338
sold these dml to that have actually transformed
these dmls into a working product for the

1:07:26.338,1:07:27.338
and we did prototypes at the ofc we are doing
samples now and six months later well on track

1:07:27.338,1:07:28.338
one with our roadmap to be able to take this
into production early next year on the extreme

1:07:28.338,1:07:29.338
right hand side you see our product this is
specifically for adverb again first of the

1:07:29.338,1:07:30.338
kind in the world a full chip on board implementation
of a 16 lane architecture that fits inside

1:07:30.338,1:07:31.338
of a qsfpdd form factor it's a 16 lane product
didn't have any other path to making this

1:07:31.338,1:07:32.338
we were the only choice they're actively architecting
this they have a customer business that is

1:07:32.338,1:07:33.338
keenly awaiting this product to be made available
to them and so we're stoked i mean we're in

1:07:33.338,1:07:34.338
this particular case we we made this product
line happen through our innovation and these

1:07:34.338,1:07:35.338
products are now ready and basically a waiting
advert to have their module design completed

1:07:35.338,1:07:36.338
so that you know they can take it into production
and there's obviously a lot of motivation

1:07:36.338,1:07:37.338
on their part to do that given um the uniqueness
of the solution in the market we're also the

1:07:37.338,1:07:38.338
first company to do wafer level remote laser
solutions for co-packaged optics and ai our

1:07:38.338,1:07:39.338
product release plans for 2023 and 2024 we
we have come a long way about a year ago we

1:07:39.338,1:07:40.338
were demonstrating 100 gig products one year
later we're demonstrating 800 gigabit products

1:07:40.338,1:07:41.338
sampling 800 gigabits today we've released
our 100 gig receiver as well as transmitters

1:07:41.338,1:07:42.338
and we have three additional variants on the
100 gig one is the what we call poet one or

1:07:42.338,1:07:43.338
the fully integrated single chip pxrx solution
this is going to be a product that we're going

1:07:43.338,1:07:44.338
to take into the telecom market in china with
our customer bfyy and their end customers

1:07:44.338,1:07:45.338
the likes of china mobile and so that will
be released at the end of q3 we also have

1:07:45.338,1:07:46.338
lr4 products not just the one we did for advert
but you know conventional lr4 uh that there

1:07:46.338,1:07:47.338
are at least four customers that were sampling
to today again will be released in q3 we completed

1:07:47.338,1:07:48.338
our beta for our 200 gig products that'll
be released in q3 as well 400 gig really receivers

1:07:48.338,1:07:49.338
have been released 800 gig receivers and transmitters
end of the year you can count the number of

1:07:49.338,1:07:50.338
products we're going to be releasing this
year it is insane but it's possible because

1:07:50.338,1:07:51.338
of you know our our interposer technology
the platform approach the fact that we use

1:07:51.338,1:07:52.338
known good components and the moment we've
been able to ally with some of the top optical

1:07:52.338,1:07:53.338
component suppliers we've been able to demonstrate
the value that the engine provides in this

1:07:53.338,1:07:54.338
context which is converting a dml laser into
an engine with good rf right in enhanced capability

1:07:54.338,1:07:55.338
and what poet would like to do is to be able
to generate modules for three 800 gig which

1:07:55.338,1:07:56.338
is critical not just for data communications
like custom modules for in 800 gig are also

1:07:56.338,1:07:57.338
used extensively in ai on the other side we
have you know a set of remote light source

1:07:57.338,1:07:58.338
products that we are still developing i mean
i think our goal is to be able to really expand

1:07:58.338,1:07:59.338
our portfolio in the space with key investments
that we want to be able to make where we believe

1:07:59.338,1:08:00.338
that we have the ability to really make a
a very meaningful contribution in this growing

1:08:00.338,1:08:01.338
market of artificial intelligence not just
because we might have extremely differentiated

1:08:01.338,1:08:02.338
dml based 800 gigahertz modules but also very
differentiated remote light source we've been

1:08:02.338,1:08:03.338
really busy as a company year to date in 2023
we've announced key engagements with customers

1:08:03.338,1:08:04.338
adverb lux share luxury is a billion dollar
company right they sell primarily to apple

1:08:04.338,1:08:05.338
and others and they've got a business and
an access to the hyperscale market we're designed

1:08:05.338,1:08:06.338
in already with their 800 gigabit solutions
with our receivers in fact we've gotten initial

1:08:06.338,1:08:07.338
fields right these are sample quantity pos
which which is which is common uh early in

1:08:07.338,1:08:08.338
the in the in the development where we provide
engines for them to be able to develop their

1:08:08.338,1:08:09.338
modules bfyy our first foray into telecom
the exposure into a really large market there

1:08:09.338,1:08:10.338
which are the mobile players the big mobile
players and the telecom states in china the

1:08:10.338,1:08:11.338
poet infinity product line we announced our
engagement with celestial with this new class

1:08:11.338,1:08:12.338
of products for their applications we've received
the purchase order from them for supplying

1:08:12.338,1:08:13.338
product next year and we also announced some
product announcements right around the lines

1:08:13.338,1:08:14.338
of infinity announced the availability of
these products sampling of 800 gig it it's

1:08:14.338,1:08:15.338
been a busy year and and we expect you know
that as we release more products over the

1:08:15.338,1:08:16.338
next couple of quarters to be able to announce
additional customers additional engagements

1:08:16.338,1:08:17.338
and and we do believe that we can keep up
with what needs to be done in terms of kind

1:08:17.338,1:08:18.338
of gaining traction and gaining engagement
around this this platform we have 11 current

1:08:18.338,1:08:19.338
projects with seven key customers um and just
these projects represent a combined 150 million

1:08:19.338,1:08:20.338
dollars of revenue potential over three years
just these problems nothing new but we do

1:08:20.338,1:08:21.338
expect something new right we've got another
a bunch of products that we're planning to

1:08:21.338,1:08:22.338
release over the course of the next couple
of months and we do believe that when those

1:08:22.338,1:08:23.338
products are released there will be more take
up more engagements right but based on what

1:08:23.338,1:08:24.338
our customers tell us about these products
and when they intend to rev and their potential

1:08:24.338,1:08:25.338
forecasts for these products we estimate that
for poet and super photonics this can be a

1:08:25.338,1:08:26.338
cumulative 150 million dollars of revenue
potential right so they're successful we're

1:08:26.338,1:08:27.338
going to be successful too and it's important
for us to project and plan because we need

1:08:27.338,1:08:28.338
to have the manufacturing capability to be
able to deliver this and that's where super

1:08:28.338,1:08:29.338
photonics comes in and that's where the additional
investments from santa are going to be placed

1:08:29.338,1:08:30.338
today our technology and business strategy
is fundamentally centered around building

1:08:30.338,1:08:31.338
interposers and optical engines and providing
expertise to end customers or module makers

1:08:31.338,1:08:32.338
provide finished modules why we believe that
this is a reasonable model for kind of the

1:08:32.338,1:08:33.338
legacy if you will or 100 gigs or 200 gigs
or 400 gigs especially in the ai segment you

1:08:33.338,1:08:34.338
know we think we have to transcend beyond
the optical engine and create optical modules

1:08:34.338,1:08:35.338
so the future for poet is to actually create
optical modules and we believe we can do that

1:08:35.338,1:08:36.338
because a big portion of the optical module
is already factored into the engine we've

1:08:36.338,1:08:37.338
integrated tiers we've integrated drivers
we've got very good rf capability on the interposer

1:08:37.338,1:08:38.338
we've got all the photonics components on
the interposer we create effectively everything

1:08:38.338,1:08:39.338
except the dsp so our intent is to add a third
set of capabilities for design and development

1:08:39.338,1:08:40.338
of these optical modules uh we're already
doing it for ai it's a critical requirement

1:08:40.338,1:08:41.338
for ai so our intent in ai is clearly to have
optical modules generated so it doesn't mean

1:08:41.338,1:08:42.338
that we're going to sell engines to module
makers i think in the advanced technology

1:08:42.338,1:08:43.338
specifically for ai our intent would be to
create optical modules it enables the sale

1:08:43.338,1:08:44.338
of our leading edge products directly to the
end customer without having to go through

1:08:44.338,1:08:45.338
this middleman and this long process of getting
designed in and the iterations associated

1:08:45.338,1:08:46.338
with more development to be done along the
way it reduces time to market eliminates qualification

1:08:46.338,1:08:47.338
cycles we think it's the right thing to do
it requires some investment and we're looking

1:08:47.338,1:08:48.338
at a you know an alternate joint venture capability
that allows us to potentially fund this activity

1:08:48.338,1:08:49.338
again you know raising money with some non-diluted
financing here in 2020 when we created the

1:08:49.338,1:08:50.338
joint venture in china you know china was
in fashion i mean we were complemented for

1:08:50.338,1:08:51.338
having done that you know today i read the
boards and you know of course everybody barfs

1:08:51.338,1:08:52.338
on the fact that we have manufacturing in
china but it is important to understand that

1:08:52.338,1:08:53.338
it is a very very very large market it is
in fact the largest market for optics 100

1:08:53.338,1:08:54.338
to 400 gigabits per second but we recognize
that things have changed um there are geopolitical

1:08:54.338,1:08:55.338
issues um there is likely to be more and more
constraints and high-end in ai nai solutions

1:08:55.338,1:08:56.338
and so we intend to create an alternate joint
venture outside of china and follow what we

1:08:56.338,1:08:57.338
would call a china plus one strategy which
a lot of customers require or demand where

1:08:57.338,1:08:58.338
we have a foot in china to support kind of
the chinese market with china components and

1:08:58.338,1:08:59.338
then we have kind of you know the the ability
to to be able to manufacture outside of china

1:08:59.338,1:09:00.338
as well so we're actively seeking as i said
an additional jv partner to provide a source

1:09:00.338,1:09:01.338
of independent financing for this this is
critical to poet's future and we believe we

1:09:01.338,1:09:02.338
can be very very successful in this endeavor
i'm sorry my uh ability to move the slides

1:09:02.338,1:09:03.338
is somewhat delayed uh we've done a fair bit
on the investor outreach front um you know

1:09:03.338,1:09:04.338
our goal was to increase awareness of put
so audience is likely to invest with a focus

1:09:04.338,1:09:05.338
on the u.s we've taken various steps to do
that some popular some not so popular but

1:09:05.338,1:09:06.338
the results speak for themselves we've had
a 300 growth and monthly website visits from

1:09:06.338,1:09:07.338
december to june a hundred percent month over
month visit growth from may 31 u.s visitors

1:09:07.338,1:09:08.338
to canadian visitors which was a big thing
right we wanted to get more presence in the

1:09:08.338,1:09:09.338
us our nasdaq volumes are finally higher than
psx venture and has been up since december

1:09:09.338,1:09:10.338
so we will continue to attack and adapt of
course you know not everything that we do

1:09:10.338,1:09:11.338
works beautifully we have a path we have a
vision we want to get something done but you

1:09:11.338,1:09:12.338
know as with everything else you have to attack
and adapt and we are but but the results speak

1:09:12.338,1:09:13.338
for themselves and we will continue to drive
this going forward so in summary we've created

1:09:13.338,1:09:14.338
an innovative patented optoelectronic integration
platform technology we believe we're the only

1:09:14.338,1:09:15.338
known technology that can meet the vectors
of volume size cost power for future photonics

1:09:15.338,1:09:16.338
products especially in large high growth markets
including datacom telecom and ai hardware

1:09:16.338,1:09:17.338
we are partnered with some of the leading
companies in the optical communications supply

1:09:17.338,1:09:18.338
chain we're engaged with several key customers
now that allows us to demonstrate the technical

1:09:18.338,1:09:19.338
acceptance of our solution i mean we are after
all doing something that has not been done

1:09:19.338,1:09:20.338
before we are after all creating products
are that are first of its kind in the industry

1:09:20.338,1:09:21.338
and there's some degree of healthy skepticism
about whether we can actually do it and that's

1:09:21.338,1:09:22.338
skepticism first is can it be done technically
then it's can it actually meet specs and then

1:09:22.338,1:09:23.338
it's can you actually scale this in volume
and we're going through that process super

1:09:23.338,1:09:24.338
photonics is critical to enable market acceptance
of our optical engine products we're doing

1:09:24.338,1:09:25.338
that today they're ramping up we have a revenue
pipeline on customer engagements that provide

1:09:25.338,1:09:26.338
150 million dollars of three-year estimated
revenues based on their projections to us

1:09:26.338,1:09:27.338
of course there's no guarantees but you know
they know their business they know their customers

1:09:27.338,1:09:28.338
and they believe that they can represent us
what it would mean to us with this engagement

1:09:28.338,1:09:29.338
we expect revenue to begin in 2024 but of
course we will have production orders this

1:09:29.338,1:09:30.338
year we already do for the first half of next
year three million dollars from the fyy we

1:09:30.338,1:09:31.338
expect pos this year as well in fact super
photonics does have evos but like i said these

1:09:31.338,1:09:32.338
are quantities that enable our customers to
design their modules in although our engines

1:09:32.338,1:09:33.338
are ready you know we can't ramp into production
until our customer or so in this case super

1:09:33.338,1:09:34.338
photonics this customer can ramp their solution
and in some cases there have been some delays

1:09:34.338,1:09:35.338
because they have never used optical engines
before and so it's a learning process for

1:09:35.338,1:09:36.338
them as well so we kind of go through that
i mean it's you know there there are changes

1:09:36.338,1:09:37.338
and and to our roadmap sometimes out of our
control you know our products are ready and

1:09:37.338,1:09:38.338
available and sampling and providing to the
customers and then we just have to work through

1:09:38.338,1:09:39.338
the process of getting them designed in and
i think we're the likes at the end of the

1:09:39.338,1:09:40.338
tunnel we can see it we've we work with these
customers and and we do believe over the next

1:09:40.338,1:09:41.338
couple of quarters that um that we should
or super photonics should be able to start

1:09:41.338,1:09:42.338
start their ramp right and most significantly
we've created a significant value capture

1:09:42.338,1:09:43.338
potential with super photonics in terms of
its asset appreciation and what that can mean

1:09:43.338,1:09:44.338
to poet in terms of non-diluted financing
the company we need it right we need the financing

1:09:44.338,1:09:45.338
to be able to keep our roadmap to drive our
leadership in a sense in the ai space to really

1:09:45.338,1:09:46.338
take advantage of our existing position and
grow it and and we think that this is a very

1:09:46.338,1:09:47.338
very critical piece of you know how how that
can happen in in the long term so with that

1:09:47.338,1:09:48.338
you know let me close and and i thank you
for your time i thank you for your attention

1:09:48.338,1:09:49.338
i thank you for your support go put i hand
it over to you at this point all right i'll

1:09:49.338,1:09:50.338
jump in i think uh suresh with some questions
uh from uh from the from the group at uh gopode

1:09:50.338,1:09:51.338
indeed uh tell us what your objectives were
with the atm or aftermarket financing that

1:09:51.338,1:09:52.338
was announced this morning oh sorry um i think
i was i might have met him been on mute uh

1:09:52.338,1:09:53.338
can you repeat that because it just didn't
come through clearly on my end sure uh tell

1:09:53.338,1:09:54.338
us what your objectives were with the atm
or the at the market financing that was announced

1:09:54.338,1:09:55.338
this morning oh yeah the the atm or at the
market program you know it gives port management

1:09:55.338,1:09:56.338
the flexibility to raise capital in small
amounts over the course of the next year um

1:09:56.338,1:09:57.338
i think there's uh a lot of misunderstandings
um associated with the mechanics of how atm

1:09:57.338,1:09:58.338
works so i will shortly kind of ask tom to
maybe step in and and paint some color and

1:09:58.338,1:09:59.338
and provide some some guidance there um but
as as the atm itself it's the least costly

1:09:59.338,1:10:00.338
method for the company to raise capital in
the public markets low commissions compared

1:10:00.338,1:10:01.338
to public offerings no warrants attached you're
basically selling shares at market price no

1:10:01.338,1:10:02.338
discounts so the atm programs have been common
among issues in the united states for several

1:10:02.338,1:10:03.338
years and have become much more popular now
recently in canada and we believe that an

1:10:03.338,1:10:04.338
atm is an essential part of a financing strategy
of a high growth technology-based company

1:10:04.338,1:10:05.338
but you know the mechanics of the atm is i
guess misunderstood and um so perhaps tom

1:10:05.338,1:10:06.338
you might want to take a few minutes to explain
how the mechanics work sure i'd be happy to

1:10:06.338,1:10:07.338
suresh thank you uh what i want to emphasize
first is is that this is not a 30 million

1:10:07.338,1:10:08.338
dollar financing that we're doing today or
any time in the in the near future it's very

1:10:08.338,1:10:09.338
much misunderstood as being that it's a facility
that allows us the company to sell shares

1:10:09.338,1:10:10.338
at the market price and we're it's a heavily
regulated transaction so we're we have to

1:10:10.338,1:10:11.338
be cautious about whether our intervention
or our sale of shares into that market moves

1:10:11.338,1:10:12.338
the market so we're intending over the course
of the next 12 months to take advantage of

1:10:12.338,1:10:13.338
high volume days in which we believe we can
sell co-chairs at a reasonable and appropriate

1:10:13.338,1:10:14.338
price and the way that that happens is the
there were two investment banks uh that were

1:10:14.338,1:10:15.338
named in the prospectus one is craig hallam
in the united states who many of you know

1:10:15.338,1:10:16.338
uh follows us through richard shannon uh their
analysts in the optics area and in canada

1:10:16.338,1:10:17.338
core mark that has been an investment bank
for us for a couple of transactions few transactions

1:10:17.338,1:10:18.338
over the past couple of years so i have access
to a particular trader at each of those desks

1:10:18.338,1:10:19.338
and we convene early in the morning and see
what the market activity is going to be project

1:10:19.338,1:10:20.338
what we think the market activity may be during
the week and we determine at that time whether

1:10:20.338,1:10:21.338
or not we're going to be selling any shares
into the market we are totally in control

1:10:21.338,1:10:22.338
of the price at which we sell shares and the
number of shares that we sell and so having

1:10:22.338,1:10:23.338
that kind of facility around allows us to
raise capital in the public market as suresh

1:10:23.338,1:10:24.338
said at the lowest cost it's a three percent
commission rather than a seven percent commission

1:10:24.338,1:10:25.338
and there are no warrants and it's at the
market so we're not really you know competing

1:10:25.338,1:10:26.338
against um others to to who want to buy or
sell our shares so it's important to remember

1:10:26.338,1:10:27.338
that this is a facility that we have that
will completely in control of it's been very

1:10:27.338,1:10:28.338
common as suresh said in the united states
for a long time among most issuers and in

1:10:28.338,1:10:29.338
canada because they've relaxed the rules somewhat
over the last two years it's becoming more

1:10:29.338,1:10:30.338
common and i think you'll see it in many other
issuers uh up in canada so we're going to

1:10:30.338,1:10:31.338
be we're going to be looking at both markets
over time and as i said we're um we have to

1:10:31.338,1:10:32.338
be very cautious about not moving the market
in any way and i'm sure that the regulators

1:10:32.338,1:10:33.338
will be watching that over the course of the
next 12 months um okay so thank you thanks

1:10:33.338,1:10:34.338
uh tom thanks uh suresh on on giving us some
background on that uh following on the same

1:10:34.338,1:10:35.338
topic how does the company plan to fund itself
for the next six to 12 months while ramping

1:10:35.338,1:10:36.338
production and does the company need or plan
to raise additional capital before the end

1:10:36.338,1:10:37.338
of 2023 beyond what you've already mentioned
yeah i put current stage we're continuously

1:10:37.338,1:10:38.338
evaluating the capital required to operate
the business and execute on our ongoing strategic

1:10:38.338,1:10:39.338
initiatives um as part of this process we're
actively considering several potential alternatives

1:10:39.338,1:10:40.338
non-dilutive means of bringing in additional
capital as mentioned in the presentation we

1:10:40.338,1:10:41.338
believe that our equity in spx is a valuable
asset that is not obvious in our financial

1:10:41.338,1:10:42.338
statements and we have been approached by
private equity companies interested in owning

1:10:42.338,1:10:43.338
a piece of that operation which both jv partners
believe is a good prospect for an ipo in china

1:10:43.338,1:10:44.338
so once spx begins to generate revenue we
expect its value to increase exponentially

1:10:44.338,1:10:45.338
in addition in connection with our plan to
sell modules we believe that there are good

1:10:45.338,1:10:46.338
opportunities to form additional joint ventures
um if you were to create a new jv for module

1:10:46.338,1:10:47.338
production we would expect to structure it
uh in a way to both provide capital to pull

1:10:47.338,1:10:48.338
it and also to allow us to consolidate its
results in our financial statements okay and

1:10:48.338,1:10:49.338
um moving on to a question on some of our
early adopters our early customers uh when

1:10:49.338,1:10:50.338
uh when do we expect to be in production or
have receive initial orders from adva and

1:10:50.338,1:10:51.338
fiber top for some of the poet legacy that
um they're contracting as i said i mean you

1:10:51.338,1:10:52.338
know i think initial orders we've had it we've
delivered it that cx has rather um you know

1:10:52.338,1:10:53.338
i think the the key thing is you know how
quickly can they complete their module design

1:10:53.338,1:10:54.338
and um and it's gone through some iterations
um you know these are these are companies

1:10:54.338,1:10:55.338
i mean not used to working with optical engines
in the case of our advert it's it's uh i mean

1:10:55.338,1:10:56.338
like i said 16 channels in a case of pdd never
been done before um so they're going through

1:10:56.338,1:10:57.338
some learning curves on their end right our
designs are complete the products ready um

1:10:57.338,1:10:58.338
but we believe they're closed and and they
do have an end market that they can sell them

1:10:58.338,1:10:59.338
to their customers are waiting so there's
motivational and best of interest of the part

1:10:59.338,1:11:00.338
of them to finish their module design we expect
that this happens over the course of this

1:11:00.338,1:11:01.338
quarter uh honestly um i think now that we
have the ability to travel to china and i

1:11:01.338,1:11:02.338
believe roger is there next week you know
we're going to be able to get much better

1:11:02.338,1:11:03.338
engagement with them and you know hasten their
development in the case of fiber top for example

1:11:03.338,1:11:04.338
but but i mean they're engaged we've got weekly
meetings um it's hard to project and predict

1:11:04.338,1:11:05.338
exactly when they're gonna rank you know i
mean this is this has been our challenge as

1:11:05.338,1:11:06.338
well and that you know our products ready
uh we will release it at the end of this coming

1:11:06.338,1:11:07.338
quarter and kill three but does that mean
it ramps immediately probably not but it's

1:11:07.338,1:11:08.338
not very far and and for sure it's not a question
of if and when but but rather when the opportunity

1:11:08.338,1:11:09.338
is there the value potential is there um we
just need to we need our customer in a sense

1:11:09.338,1:11:10.338
um to begin their ramp which which we do expect
uh to happen in 24 with like i said initial

1:11:10.338,1:11:11.338
production will start at the end of this year
but but really the the meaningful production

1:11:11.338,1:11:12.338
will be in 2024. um but that's you know largely
given their schedule right i mean it's it's

1:11:12.338,1:11:13.338
it's hard for us to kind of really push that
on on our end uh aggressively i think the

1:11:13.338,1:11:14.338
best we can do is to release the product and
have it available and you know work with them

1:11:14.338,1:11:15.338
closely which is what the team's doing um
to enable their design to be completed okay

1:11:15.338,1:11:16.338
terrific uh on to a couple of questions or
back to the stock price as a topic uh two

1:11:16.338,1:11:17.338
questions on that what strategy is being employed
to attract new institutional investors and

1:11:17.338,1:11:18.338
what gives you the confidence it will be effective
look i mean over the past 18 months i think

1:11:18.338,1:11:19.338
it's yeah about about the time we kind of
moved to the nasdaq um or about the time russia

1:11:19.338,1:11:20.338
in the end of ukraine whichever way you look
at it um we have participated in nine wall

1:11:20.338,1:11:21.338
street focused conferences targeted at institutional
retail investors in the us we have we remain

1:11:21.338,1:11:22.338
engaged with and distribute all announced
business developments with a sizable number

1:11:22.338,1:11:23.338
of institutional investor targets which are
continuing to follow poet's progress we've

1:11:23.338,1:11:24.338
also stayed actively engaged with multiple
south side research analysts including our

1:11:24.338,1:11:25.338
existing covering analysts such as richard
richard shannon at greg hallo who initiated

1:11:25.338,1:11:26.338
last year and has continued to provide forward
with much broader exposure is highly recognized

1:11:26.338,1:11:27.338
in the industry he covers momentum and some
of the larger companies right so he knows

1:11:27.338,1:11:28.338
what he's talking about and i think he's respected
and recognized additionally we have been driving

1:11:28.338,1:11:29.338
increased visibility through participation
and presentations and industry trade shows

1:11:29.338,1:11:30.338
i think just this week we had a a video that
was actually in chinese created by mo you

1:11:30.338,1:11:31.338
know that that got a lot of inbound traction
um when it was published at the industry trade

1:11:31.338,1:11:32.338
show there so this all contributes to elevated
awareness not just among customers but but

1:11:32.338,1:11:33.338
also tech oriented investors okay and what
else is the company doing to increase the

1:11:33.338,1:11:34.338
current uh share price look at shareholders
ourselves um we're always looking at new ways

1:11:34.338,1:11:35.338
to support our stock price and attract new
investors our top priority as a management

1:11:35.338,1:11:36.338
team is to create shareholder value through
continued execution on our business plan and

1:11:36.338,1:11:37.338
begin generating a sustainable and growing
revenue stream to the extent that we are successful

1:11:37.338,1:11:38.338
in capturing even a portion of the available
market opportunity we believe the stock price

1:11:38.338,1:11:39.338
will ultimately reflect that value appropriately
to help further expand our investor outreach

1:11:39.338,1:11:40.338
efforts in january we retain stockhouse to
help execute an advertising and marketing

1:11:40.338,1:11:41.338
campaign that has seen increased interest
through website visitation as well as expanded

1:11:41.338,1:11:42.338
awareness via newsletters and digital marketing
then in april we engaged he capital markets

1:11:42.338,1:11:43.338
for distribution of our company's content
on investors hub and wall street silver services

1:11:43.338,1:11:44.338
we also continue to actively participate in
wall street focused events conferences speaking

1:11:44.338,1:11:45.338
opportunities the one thing i'd like to point
out is that poetstalk is up what over 40 year

1:11:45.338,1:11:46.338
to date and even over the past 12 months we've
kind of meaningfully outperformed a large

1:11:46.338,1:11:47.338
majority of publicly traded micro cap tech
companies it's not been an easy market folks

1:11:47.338,1:11:48.338
um but you know there's there's still just
satisfaction obviously and um you know but

1:11:48.338,1:11:49.338
what we can do is is manage what is on our
control and that is execute our roadmap which

1:11:49.338,1:11:50.338
we've been doing and you've seen it you know
we've provided our roadmap and we periodically

1:11:50.338,1:11:51.338
give you updates and we're on track and what
do you think uh then suresh based on this

1:11:51.338,1:11:52.338
activity that poets valuation should be now
based on the progress that you've outlined

1:11:52.338,1:11:53.338
what we've made this year i i don't think
it's an it's it's my job to comment on on

1:11:53.338,1:11:54.338
valuations so i i don't think i'm going to
answer that question okay and let's uh let's

1:11:54.338,1:11:55.338
have one here on uh when can we expect to
see additional buying and or exercising of

1:11:55.338,1:11:56.338
warrants by insights look i mean i think most
of the warrants are are done there's probably

1:11:56.338,1:11:57.338
a single crunch of warrants left in august
um so yeah i mean i think uh you know i i

1:11:57.338,1:11:58.338
like like i said i don't i don't control what
other management members of the board do in

1:11:58.338,1:11:59.338
poet we're all independent um folks um so
yeah i i don't think there's uh a lot more

1:11:59.338,1:12:00.338
warrants left honestly to be exercised than
we we'd like to keep it that way going forward

1:12:00.338,1:12:01.338
too okay and and with the stock trading where
it is today how committed is management and

1:12:01.338,1:12:02.338
the board to resisting a potential unsolicited
buyer to offer at an attractive valuation

1:12:02.338,1:12:03.338
oh um and you know look uh our our interest
is is in building you know long-term shareholder

1:12:03.338,1:12:04.338
value and um and so you know i think we're
uh we recognize and understand the value we

1:12:04.338,1:12:05.338
bring and we recognize and understand the
value um that is achievable and so you know

1:12:05.338,1:12:06.338
i don't think this is a concern that existing
shareholders need to have i think you know

1:12:06.338,1:12:07.338
we all collectively are vested in doing what
is necessary to drive uh shareholder value

1:12:07.338,1:12:08.338
at valuations that we believe uh accurately
represents uh what we offer uh in the industry

1:12:08.338,1:12:09.338
right and what we offer to this large and
growing market uh especially in ai okay and

1:12:09.338,1:12:10.338
we have a question here um about uh competitors
both uh well let's go within nvidia are they're

1:12:10.338,1:12:11.338
currently the kings of the ai market how could
poet uh enhance their offering look i think

1:12:11.338,1:12:12.338
you know and i mean nvidia the kings and the
ai market because they create uh you know

1:12:12.338,1:12:13.338
highly parallel computing infrastructure with
their gpus and then you know they tie it up

1:12:13.338,1:12:14.338
with with large amounts of memory and and
sell these pgx boxes at 30 40 000 a pop um

1:12:14.338,1:12:15.338
but you know i think going forward i mean
you know i think data center servers are going

1:12:15.338,1:12:16.338
to incorporate in video graphics processors
and so on and so forth so yes they're they're

1:12:16.338,1:12:17.338
they're a graphics company there are kings
there um i think how poet helps is uh is by

1:12:17.338,1:12:18.338
providing you know the means to communicate
either between graphics and memory or by providing

1:12:18.338,1:12:19.338
the means to communicate between servers um
and you know today much of that is done either

1:12:19.338,1:12:20.338
by you know 800 gig and a transceiver modules
they look like transceiver modules but they're

1:12:20.338,1:12:21.338
kind of custom specifically for ai um or um
they can take the form of photonic fabrics

1:12:21.338,1:12:22.338
um and and other such uh applications that
there are other companies kind of driving

1:12:22.338,1:12:23.338
and so so the ai segment is kind of bifurcated
right one is there's just a growth or a need

1:12:23.338,1:12:24.338
for a lot of optics and that is bifurcated
into kind of transceiver like form factors

1:12:24.338,1:12:25.338
which we plan to and then into photonic fabric
like form factors with new companies and upcoming

1:12:25.338,1:12:26.338
companies that again we play into by providing
remote light sources so i think we're um we're

1:12:26.338,1:12:27.338
well covered uh in terms of what we can do
and um and are actively working to intercept

1:12:27.338,1:12:28.338
this very large growth market over the next
couple of years okay of the 11th current uh

1:12:28.338,1:12:29.338
contracted uh projects that you uh stated
uh having today which one or two represent

1:12:29.338,1:12:30.338
the largest near-term revenue opportunities
i guess this is specifically with our products

1:12:30.338,1:12:31.338
and our customers and what are the remaining
steps to convert these opportunities into

1:12:31.338,1:12:32.338
revenue well i mean i think for most part
these are committed projects i mean i think

1:12:32.338,1:12:33.338
we're going through the development phases
in the case of companies like celestial and

1:12:33.338,1:12:34.338
their projected volumes to us i mean you know
those are products that are committed and

1:12:34.338,1:12:35.338
we have pos we have to deliver all the teams
working on you know finishing up that design

1:12:35.338,1:12:36.338
by the end of this year and you know we have
a po to deliver a certain number of those

1:12:36.338,1:12:37.338
uh engines by by the end of 2024 for you know
kind of a larger ramp next year um turn most

1:12:37.338,1:12:38.338
of those except for one i believe uh which
is still um you know in evaluation by the

1:12:38.338,1:12:39.338
customer um there are commitments to use the
products they are designed in so then it's

1:12:39.338,1:12:40.338
it's not to me a question of if then it's
a question of when that when depends less

1:12:40.338,1:12:41.338
on poet's readiness and more on our customers
you know ability to convert that into a module

1:12:41.338,1:12:42.338
design and then ultimately take it and and
be successful in the market um but you know

1:12:42.338,1:12:43.338
on a balance you know i think we're well positioned
there with with a really good potential okay

1:12:43.338,1:12:44.338
and uh regarding air labs do you view them
as a competitor or a potential partner neither

1:12:44.338,1:12:45.338
i view them as a as a customer a potential
customer um i mean they they are one of the

1:12:45.338,1:12:46.338
companies that have a photonics fabric um
they also require a remote light source and

1:12:46.338,1:12:47.338
we believe we have a good technical solution
um and uh there have been dialogues and discussions

1:12:47.338,1:12:48.338
and we hope at some point that we can convert
that opportunity into into you know a real

1:12:48.338,1:12:49.338
engagement uh and with uh uh sticking with
the products and uh the uh optical interposer

1:12:49.338,1:12:50.338
how far behind are competitors to what the
optical interposer can do i'm sorry i think

1:12:50.338,1:12:51.338
you have to repeat that question please how
far behind are the competitors to uh the optical

1:12:51.338,1:12:52.338
interposer and what it's able to deliver to
the market look i mean i have yet to see i

1:12:52.338,1:12:53.338
mean i've said this publicly before i think
the only company that had you know capability

1:12:53.338,1:12:54.338
uh or at least a vision are very similar to
what poet was discussing and talking about

1:12:54.338,1:12:55.338
was rock lee photonics um you know they ultimately
were not successful in creating these products

1:12:55.338,1:12:56.338
and data communications i mean we've we've
successfully sampled 800 gig receivers because

1:12:56.338,1:12:57.338
it's i mean you know we we we've done we've
come a long ways relative to what others thought

1:12:57.338,1:12:58.338
they could do but couldn't ultimately do it
um now outside of them i'm not seeing too

1:12:58.338,1:12:59.338
many single things sorry uh no that's good
that's uh uh regarding the light bar have

1:12:59.338,1:13:00.338
other companies tested the light bar family
products and how are those samples um being

1:13:00.338,1:13:01.338
received and can we expect future announcements
there's a little bit of i mean ambiguity among

1:13:01.338,1:13:02.338
the customer base especially as it relates
to copaceted optics or um or remote blazers

1:13:02.338,1:13:03.338
um it is a very very custom market it's a
kind of a wild west right now there's no there's

1:13:03.338,1:13:04.338
no kind of standards um you know what our
labs uses is something completely different

1:13:04.338,1:13:05.338
what celestial wants is something completely
different what light matter uses something

1:13:05.338,1:13:06.338
completely different like the legends is completely
different they're all different right and

1:13:06.338,1:13:07.338
so what you know um in in a sense it plays
to our strength because we've got a platform

1:13:07.338,1:13:08.338
we have the ability to adopt these solutions
um but you know it's also difficult because

1:13:08.338,1:13:09.338
we keep sampling and talking to customers
and they change their requirements and needs

1:13:09.338,1:13:10.338
sometimes it's four channels it grows to eight
and it's 12 and um so yeah i think you know

1:13:10.338,1:13:11.338
well the good thing is we've got the right
products and we've got the relationships and

1:13:11.338,1:13:12.338
the engagement uh and we do believe that you
know as those requirements and needs develop

1:13:12.338,1:13:13.338
and coalesce into something uh we will have
the solutions available for them um but um

1:13:13.338,1:13:14.338
today our primary focus is you know ensure
a successful deployment on celestial ai i

1:13:14.338,1:13:15.338
mean honestly uh if they are half as successful
as they think they're going to be and have

1:13:15.338,1:13:16.338
represented in their uh forecast that i'm
sure you can read up um you can see how lucrative

1:13:16.338,1:13:17.338
just simply that is going to be for this company
um and then you add one or two i think the

1:13:17.338,1:13:18.338
intent is really not to go we're not here
trying to get numbers in terms of customers

1:13:18.338,1:13:19.338
we're trying to get wins win with the winners
right and and and we think if we can you know

1:13:19.338,1:13:20.338
just convert a couple of them um these are
really really large opportunities ahead of

1:13:20.338,1:13:21.338
us and i've got one here on uh that's i know
the the team is excited about the this application

1:13:21.338,1:13:22.338
with film thin film lithium nibate uh can
you comment on on that and how's that progressing

1:13:22.338,1:13:23.338
future you know the important thing is that
we have the ability to to incorporate new

1:13:23.338,1:13:24.338
and upcoming components onto our interposer
uh but look i mean you know 10 from lithium

1:13:24.338,1:13:25.338
live here is not going to be ready for prime
time in terms of kind of commercial volumes

1:13:25.338,1:13:26.338
for it for it's at least three years um so
you know i think it's it's it's something

1:13:26.338,1:13:27.338
that we're engaged with in this case you know
um liabate on and and we're working with them

1:13:27.338,1:13:28.338
in parallel but you know we've also got a
focus on products that you know we know are

1:13:28.338,1:13:29.338
imminently required um so we are you know
initiating our development programs around

1:13:29.338,1:13:30.338
a 200 gig per lane eml based solutions that
those are the most mature solutions for 200

1:13:30.338,1:13:31.338
gigabit per lane today um lithium-908 will
be there at some point but you know i think

1:13:31.338,1:13:32.338
we we need to we need to work with components
that are ready today um and and leverage them

1:13:32.338,1:13:33.338
fast and rapidly you know and not keep betting
the form on some future um i think we made

1:13:33.338,1:13:34.338
that mistake a year and a half ago with so
you know waiting for a silicon photonics modulator

1:13:34.338,1:13:35.338
to be available and we lost a year on our
roadmap and i don't think we're ready to make

1:13:35.338,1:13:36.338
that mistake again uh no certainly not and
lots lots going on with with the company and

1:13:36.338,1:13:37.338
that i don't see any more questions uh ceresha
i'm just going to throw it back to you for

1:13:37.338,1:13:38.338
some closing remarks yeah well i mean you
know it's uh it's been a it's been a an exciting

1:13:38.338,1:13:39.338
year so far um you know we've we've got a
lot of work ahead of us for sure um you know

1:13:39.338,1:13:40.338
we've had shareholders um that have either
express good satisfaction or dissatisfaction

1:13:40.338,1:13:41.338
and i'm hoping that we can all coalition around
the fact that you know we over the past five

1:13:41.338,1:13:42.338
years have developed something that is new
that is unique um you know we're committed

1:13:42.338,1:13:43.338
as a team to drive progress we're committed
as a team to ensure success um and and we

1:13:43.338,1:13:44.338
do believe that you know um we've got as a
company the the the products to be able to

1:13:44.338,1:13:45.338
leverage this um you know new and rapidly
growing area of ai which is going to provide

1:13:45.338,1:13:46.338
tremendous opportunity to everybody in photonics
uh including poet right and and so and you

1:13:46.338,1:13:47.338
know the good thing is we're well positioned
to capitalize on it because it kind of plays

1:13:47.338,1:13:48.338
to our strengths um so i'm i'm kind of stoked
about that looking forward to the future uh

1:13:48.338,1:13:49.338
and as always thank you for your continued
support very good uh thank you suresh i really

1:13:49.338,1:13:50.338
