“POET makes optical modules that enable optical data transmission. And this is fundamental
to scaling the presence of AI. Others make optical modules as well. But POET has developed
unique intellectual property that allows us to make these modules better, cheaper, lower
power, and larger scale than anyone else. More than cost or bill of sales it is the scale
where POET shines.” (0:02:04)

## Questions and answers

**Question:** “Of the eleven current contracted projects that you stated having today, which one or two represent the largest near-term revenue opportunities – I guess this is specifically with our products and our customers – and what are the remaining steps to convert these opportunities into revenue?“ (0:55:12)

**Dr. Suresh Venkatesan:** “Well, for most part these are committed projects. We’re going through the development phases in the case of companies like Celestial and their projected volumes to us. Those are products that are committed, and we have POs, we have to deliver. All the teams working on finishing up that design by the end of this year, and we have a PO to deliver a certain number of those engines by the end of 2024 for kind of a larger ramp next year.

So in most of those, except for one, I believe, which is still in evaluation by the customer, there are commitments to use the products. They are designed-in. So then it’s not to me a question of if-then, it’s a question of when. And that when depends less on POET’s readiness and more on our customers’ ability to convert that into a module design and then ultimately take it and be successful in the market. But on a balance, I think we’re well-positioned there with a really good potential.” (0:55:32)
