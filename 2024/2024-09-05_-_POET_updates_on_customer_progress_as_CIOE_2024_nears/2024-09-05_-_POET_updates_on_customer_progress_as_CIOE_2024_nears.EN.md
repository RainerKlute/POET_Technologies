**Adrian Brijbassi:** POET is at a busy few months with growing interest from customers and more technological achievements. Here to discuss some of the happenings is Raju Kankipati, the company’s Senior VP of Product Management and North America General Manager. Raju, you’ve had quite a busy summer.

**Raju Kankipati:** Thanks, Adrian. Yes, things have been quite busy, both on the product and customer side. 2024, for us, has been a year of execution. We have several products now that are at various stages, with some ramping to production already and some at the early sampling phase. A huge positive for us is that the customers and the industry are noticing and acknowledging our technology and the progress we’ve made. So, we have multiple design wins now, some of which we have announced already and some that are still in the works. Most of my time in the past few months has been meeting customers and managing product priorities based on the customer needs. The next phase for us is all about converting these design wins to revenue.

**Adrian Brijbassi:** Great. And recently POET announced an expansion of the work it is doing with Luxshare Tech, which is one of the largest companies in the industry. Why is Luxshare so interested in what POET is doing?

**Raju Kankipati:** So, Luxshare started with one product from us, the 800G 2xFR4 receive optical engine for their OSFP module. They've been very impressed with how easy it was to incorporate our engine inside their modules. So, those devices showed exceptional performance and cost savings for them. Luxshare wanted to broaden their product offering that featured POET. As we've said, the additional products will include POET’s transmit and receive optical engines for Luxshare’s 400G and 800G pluggable transceivers for single-mode fiber applications.

So, these will be the state-of-the-art transceivers, like really high-end, low-cost, high-volume products. And they will combine POET’s industry-leading 100G per lane and 200G per lane optical engines, and Luxshare will manufacture and sell them globally.

The fact that we now have six products and counting that are under development with Luxshare shows the flexibility of the POET Optical Interposer platform and also offers validation for our technology as a new way forward for the industry. What POET does also benefits Luxshare’s end customers, and this is very important to recognize because Luxshare sells its products to some of the biggest and most well-known end-users in the world. So, they put their trust in Luxshare to help them deliver products, and now Luxshare, more and more, is putting its trust in POET, which makes our role in the ecosystem very critical.

**Adrian Brijbassi:** Exactly true. And we're coming up to the end of summer, which usually means the beginning of more business activity. What can you tell us about what’s to come in the weeks ahead?

**Raju Kankipati:** So, there's the CIOE, which is the China International Optoelectronic Exposition, that takes place in Shenzhen in early September. Our team will be there, I’ll be there. So, we'll be performing several live demonstrations of our latest products. So, we'll be showing high-speed modules that are suitable for AI supercomputing and our external light source products that are designed for use in co-packaged optics and for chip-to-chip optical interconnects. 

Two weeks after CIOE, there’s the ECOC exhibition, a large industry conference that takes place in Frankfurt, Germany, and I'll be there speaking about 800G module designs using our interposer-based engines.

POET is also a finalist for an ECOC Innovation Award, so we are hopeful we will be named the winner, like we were with the AI Breakthrough Awards earlier this year.

And we’ll have operational news in the coming weeks that is related to existing customers and also new ones too. So, we are showing how POET’s highly integrated optical engines are the right solution to power the next wave of growth in AI. So, very exciting time, and there’s real sense within the company that the customer validation we’ve been receiving is going to deliver more and more industry adoption of our technology. We have some other interesting news or other industry initiatives that we look forward to as well.

**Adrian Brijbassi:** That's right. We have a revamped website launching soon, and we're debuting a POET newsletter to give subscribers a behind-the-scenes look at some of the happenings at the company. Keep an eye out for those initiatives. Raju, thanks again for your time. Best of luck with your travels and with managing all of the projects you've got on your hands right now.

**Raju Kankipati:** Thanks again. We’ll talk to you soon.
