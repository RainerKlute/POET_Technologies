the intermediate segment which is communications right and these are communication links that connect processor elements together GPUs to memories GPUs to GPUs or server to server communication so communication link is on the neck hello our next presentation is from Dr Suresh venkatasan executive chairman and CEO of poet technologies which trades on the NASDAQ under small poet as a reminder to the in-person attendees immediately following the presentation manageably in the front conference room for a breakout session if you like to meet with them there if you'd like to schedule one on meeting with them please see the water Tower desk and Thomas thank you thank you for your time this morning I'll spend the next few minutes talking to you about what poet does are specifically in the Industrial artificial intelligence we are a pure play data calm hardware company so we specialize in data communication hardware solutions for the broad AI market so a bit about the company you know we are particularly focused on leading Edge high-speed data transmission and this is at data rates at 800 gigabits per second and beyond which is really the sweet spot in the largest growing segment of the optical communication market within the sphere of AI hardware solutions we have developed over the past five years that poet what we believe is an industry disruptive technology platform we have customers that are currently engaged with us and our validating the technology and our tech technologies qualified for production and we expect to start generating production revenue over the course of this year and then into next we are present in extremely large high growth multi-billion dollar markets especially now with the significant growth of AI and the demand for AI clusters and the data center networks that support them we are in deep tech we are you know we have developed priority technology that are well protected by patents and create secrets and we believe you know we're we're kind of an undiscovered gem if you will within the overall AI hardware here where a microcap although we're listed you know jointly on both The tsx venture as well as the NASDAQ when people talk about AI you know we like to kind of categorize it into you know three pillars if you will you know one is largely software and services related right everything to do with chachi ppt openai a bunch of the software companies still developing what we would consider to be AI solutions on that on the extreme right side there's the plural around processing right so these are the companies that provide processing and compute power capabilities to support if you will on the growth in AI and then there's the intermediate segment which is communications right and these are communication links that connect processor elements together GPUs to memories GPUs to GPUs or server to server communications to communication links inside of AI servers and communication links inside of data centers that a glomerate these AI servers is a key piece of the overall segment of artificial intelligence look I've been in the industry for over 30 years you know when I first joined the industry the early 90s hardware was in fashioned rate and companies like Intel and Cisco and others you know really got a lot of evaluation demand on them because hardware was actually lagging if you will the ability of software to take advantage but we then went through a couple of decades in the 2000s where all the value shifted to software because the hardware underlying the software was plenty good and you know apps came out and you know a lot of the Cloud service platform software as a service all of those fintech I mean you know so there's a lot of value placed if you will on software but we now see the pendulum changing and moving again in 2020 starting 2020 it's it's again the arrow of hardware right and if you look at companies that are driving insane evaluations in the AI segment or largely hardware companies NVIDIA and likes right and everyone down the chain so we see ourselves very well positioned in this decade of hardware growth has a company that is supporting the hardware activities around AI in particular around communications you know when people talk about servers they talk about artificial intelligence data centers you know one of the things that is often overlooked is is the communication medium and and that's where poet comes in we provide these what are called optical modules or transceivers and these are basically critical hardware segments that convert electrical signal through optical signal for transmission the easiest way to think about what we do is is the analogy of Wi-Fi right a Wi-Fi router that you have in your home no doubt converts electrical signal into RF and it transmits that RF signal over air and then you know it's it's received at the other end by our computer or whatever device you've got and that completes the link likewise what we do is the polental Wi-Fi and the optical space where we convert electrical signals into light and light is then used as the medium for communication for a variety of reasons you know life is historically been the fastest form of communication of course and it also historically has also driven lowest power consumption because electrons typically consume a lot of heat as they transmit through wires and and photons are light do not have that so so we believe that you know this growth and optical communication links is starting and it's just exploding over the decade and at poet we've developed solutions that enable these optical links to be manufactured or produced at a scale that is otherwise not contemplatable without technologies like what poet has developed in the form of integration market perspective I mean clearly there is an extreme demand for these high-speed optical modules I mean NVIDIA in the space of two years has you know become one of the largest consumers of optical modules in the world because they realized very quickly that you know all of their you know encourage GPU AI server acts need to communicate optically and in order to keep up with the band with the demands that AI you know places on these servers especially when it comes to training and the amount of memory and the amount of compute powers and it is immense and the data throughput is meant which requires optics so you can see that you know there's a real inflection point and growth of these 800 gigabits per second data communication modules starting you know last year actually and then really growing over the course of the next five years and we expect that growth to be about 30% from a you know cumulative aggregate growth rate perspective but if you just focus on the high speed segment which is 800 gig and 1.6 teraby it's almost a 65% growth and we believe we're well positioned today we've developed solutions in that market we're starting to sample customers now and and it enables us to capitalize on this inflection point that we see largely driven by by AI I think most people that are analysts in the field will say AI has added you know about 17 billion to 30 billion dollars of optical transceiver sales which are these optical modules I've talked about or the course of the next five years and we don't see that trend changing dramatically because listen you know I and NVIDIA server consumes 12,000 Watts of power I mean just as a point of reference a human brain to do the same thing as 25 Watts just so you get a sense of what that disparity is in terms of power consumption so you know as more and more applications are driving the use of AI we think that overall need to reduce power consumption reduce latency is going to just become more and more and and we think we're the starting you know the beginning of a new wave if you will of photonics growth or optical growth and we think we're well positioned to be able to capitalize on that I won't make support different I mean obviously there are companies out there that are making optical modules but I would say about 80 to 90% of the modules that are manufactured today are done honestly and you know job shops garage operations largely in China that's where most of the manufacturing of these modules has moved to over the past 20 or 30 years and these are labor-intensive bill of materials and tensive processes they use still as a direct manufacturing techniques from back in the 1990s and what puts been able to do over the course of this past five years we've developed technology that automates production you know dramatically easing both cost as well as capital in terms of manufacturing these optical modules and we use basically state of the arts semiconductor technology to be able to do that you know I've been enzyme conductors for 30 plus years and I'm using our collective experience and semiconductor technology development and manufacturing investment and applying it to fuel to the world of tonics and and we've kind of coined the phrase inside a port we call it semiconductorizing the manufacturing and assembly of optical engines which is you know bringing the manufacturing of optical engines really more to the semiconductor error that can leverage the economies of scale that semiconductor manufacturing has provided the world right through Moore's law and everything else so why do we want to do that you know we think that you know existing manufacturing techniques can satisfy the world's demands for optical transceivers as it existed this past decade right so through the through the growth and cloud data centers etc but with this new wave of growth where AI you know we think that these manufacturing techniques are going to be very very difficult to scale they just require more people more widgets and and and they just don't have the automation needed and so we believe that the time is ripe for a fundamental change or shift and how photonics components are assembled and manufactured and that's why we've been pushing this term semiconductorization of photonics I think we started this in 2018 and you know today most people when I was at the conference a couple of weeks ago at the fiber conference which is the largest optical conference in the world and most people admit and acknowledge that you know what we've been pioneering over the past several years is in fact likely to be the standard in which optical devices are going to be manufactured in the future and the advantages we bring our typical advantages and semiconductors right cost size scale capital reduction and versatility you know we're able to spend a lot of different products with our integration approach to suit the needs of you know various customers and and provide that degree of versatility to the manufacturing process all this development back in 2018 and you know spent the first three years really perfecting the technology and then in 22 and 23 really started putting out products on that we called kind of optical engines these are subassemblies if you will so if you're manufacturing a car we were manufacturing an engine on so that's what we were doing in 22 and 23 so we were selling these engines to customers but you know going this year and beyond you know we're going to make the car right so we're going to make the optical modules ourselves which we believe vertically integrating ourselves to generating that module provides us a distinct in advantage in the solutions that we we have to offer and and so we're kind of moving our business you know systematically to kind of building the whole car right if you were an electric car manufacturer you sell batteries the car and so I think we've kind of developed the technology first sold the intermediate sub assembly next and now we're moving forward towards kind of building the entire module which we believe is going to provide you know us with significant growth opportunities as we kind of cut out the middleman if you will and go to the end user directly you know this week and last this past month we've announced that we've kind of got our first 800 gigabit modules and we're going to be starting to sample those two you know key customers over the course of this year and not only that you know what we're one of the I would say a handful of companies literally to have demonstrated a couple of weeks ago 1.6 terabit solutions that are now scalable to 3.2 terabits right so we've got a roadmap for the next two years ironed out and and you know kind of ready to execute within the company so we're really focused on the high end I mean we've got customers on today that are the low end they were really you know kind of Alpha customers for us in the sense that they helped us validate our technology helped us iron out all the technical and manufacturing issues and I brought us kind of to the point of manufacturing scale but really for us to you know kind of go next level it's it's 800 gig and beyond and that's where we're focused on and we're happy to be right there when the market requirements are being meeted out to us if you will buy and users from a competitive understand point you know we we stand alone in terms of what we're doing I mean there are a lot of companies doing optical modules are clearly most of them are in the conventional assembly regime some of them have a degree of integration but no one has the complete solution as it results as a result of semiconductorisation who has so you know we we do have a lead if you will on the competition in this regard although we're you know a demonymous sized company compared to the Giants you see on the left but I think that gives us an outsized opportunity to succeed in the market and and we've got a key few design ones that we believe we can capitalize on over the next couple of years to be able to really cement our growth and leadership in the space the interesting thing about this list is you know this is a list of the top companies if you will in 2022 if you just go back 10 years only two of the companies actually existed on this list and that's to say that you know when there are when markets change and inflections happen you can see a dramatic change in the top players right and that's true in any industry has particularly so and photonics so we think that you know we've got this inflection of growth due to AI we've got a disruptive technology that is well positioned to capitalize on that grow and therefore we believe we are well positioned to disrupt if you will the more traditional supply chain and not only through the sale of modules but also potentially licenses and other agreements that we can have with some of these big players that could capitalize on the technology that we've developed right now within the company so we do have products that are designed in with customers we've got you know 400 gig 800 gig solutions already designed in adverse a large European networking company luxher is of course one of the largest suppliers to Apple but they've also got a module optical module division that is designed this in celestial AI is an up-and-coming startup company there raised ton of capital and a lot of valuation making you know photonics chips for GPU memory interactions and and we're designed that company as well and then we've got a smattering of other companies in China that are designing our solutions in the good thing is you know we these solutions do go to some fairly large players in the in the end Market in terms of users and and so we're well positioned from a market acceptance standpoint that this is a technology that can meet the requirements of the market and is in fact capable of scaling up so these are key customers for us that are going to drive revenue for us in 2024 and 2025 and then of course the new products that were introducing into the market today at 800 gig and beyond are really what's going to propel us forward in terms of manufacturing of course you know we can achieve manufacturing scale without the Investments needed and capital and and will prepared through a joint venture that we did in China with a company called San they put in a lot of the Investment in terms of capital so that didn't require any cash investment from able to leverage you know our intellectual property from an assembly know how perspective to be able to create this joint venture and that joint venture is a straight state of the art clean room facility that's been established to take our technology to kind of the next level of manufacturing put on about 70% equity stake in this joint venture so there is of course the opportunity for poet to all to get a non-deliver kind of you know capital injection at the company through liquidation of some of our equity stake which we expect to happen over the course of the next year especially as we start ramping the manufacturing and then we can attract additional investors into that joint venture as well of course no companies complete without a management team you know we've got a team across the world that I believe our world class and and with very deep semiconductor and photonics hardware expertise I've been in the industry for over 30 years graduated with my PhD at purdue I was at Motorola on and then I was the senior vice president and chief technology officer at global foundries which is the second largest semiconductor foundry in the world the vac who was also our president and general manager he's been in the optics domain for over 30 years and so I think you know we have a good experience base of both people from semiconductors as well as people from traditional optics and we're able to blend the team that you know has been able to execute honestly for a 50% company you know were at the cutting bleeding edge of technology at one point six terabits per second which is Testament to both the technology in terms of its capability and simplicity but also a testament to you know what the teams have been able to accomplish so and and tom Michael was our cfos also you know extremely experienced in semiconductor hardware over the period of time as well so I think we're well positioned as a team to execute on our mission going forward and we do recognize that the end of the day investors do invest in people and so we you know I do believe we've got a terrific team that can capitalize on all of our Innovations in the company and be able to take this company to the next level in the new term we expect our revenue over the next couple of years to be in the you know 10 to 20 million dollars with customers that are already designed as in and we expect those customers to be ramping over the course of the second half of this year and then of course into next year as 800 gig and 1.6 terabits per second cement then over the midterm we really do expect that revenue to ramp quite rapidly because it doesn't require us to get a lot of share of the market to be able to get this kind of revenue because it's a very very large market that we're playing and and because we're semiconductor company fundamentally and semiconductor hardware company we do expect that grows margins would be very very consistent conventional semiconductor technology companies so healthy margins in the 40 to 50% range the key metrics you know we are on the tsx venture exchange as well as our trader in the NASDAQ you know our total outstanding shares little over 48 million fluid diluted chairs at 63 million we don't have any debt in the company so we have a market cap of about 63 million US Dollars I think we're trading at the low end of what we had you know the courses past year and and so we do think this is a great opportunity especially as we are you know getting into this manufacturing and revenue generation stage at the company we do burn about three million dollars of cash and and we expect you know to continue to inject capital both through all equity as well as non-equity raises and we're really Focus ed very heavily on the non equity raise related to technology licensing agreements that were in discussions with as well as you know some of our dilution of our equity interest in our joint venture that would inject capital into the company so we do expect that over the course of this coming year that you know we would be able to capitalize the company very effectively to take advantage of the growth opportunities that we have ahead of us that's that's about poet and I'll turn it over to the audience for questions

John you want us to all right yeah I surrassed just go back and the capital structure and cash burn it seems like you've got maybe two or three quarters left of cash with and he mentioned the future funding from licensing and JV dilution you know does that those combine get you to break even or see that you may need to go back to the markets at some point in time in the next 12 to 18 months

well I think it's a balance I mean we do expect that you know between the two that we would generate you know sufficient capital in the company to break even so I would say it's not all one or the other we don't expect to raise all of the money through an equity and a little race at this point in time I think we're well positioned with both our technology as well as recognition in the market in terms of what we can do to be able to get some non-dilitative finance into the company 

right any had some public announcements about I think the 800 gig market right recently is there is there another milestone that may be investors can hold on to as a you know benchmark or flag along the way that's it oh okay you know what now we can expect to see more maybe more consistent or yeah greater trajectory

yeah I think you know we we continue our development trajectory both in terms of technology and products as well as customer acquisition right and I think back in November you know we did some financing within the company and I was asked the same questions like one of the milestones that we have and I told them that we expect to be able to make certain announcements and March which we did right so likewise you know we would expect over the course of the coming quarter to have additional product announcements as well as additional partner and or customer announcements around especially the leading edge right so we all you know we're working on you know things today I mean based on you know our solutions that we had announced a couple of weeks ago so you know those take a little bit of time to cook but you know we expect over the course of the quarter to be able to show that you know some of these leading Edge solutions are in fact being taken up and and it's driving a lot of excitement like I said at one point six terabits per second you know overseeing is a massive acceleration of bandwidth if you will on because of AI and we were literally you know I could count the number of companies that were demonstrating 1.6 terabits in one hand at the conference you know a couple of weeks ago and we were one of them so there is a lot of interest in working with us on generating you know these solutions which is really important especially in the segment you know it's kind of really important to get really out of the bleeding Edge and then and then that the solutions then kind of trickle down from there so we're well positioned there and we're happy about that

thank you very much if you have any other questions for him he is available to meet after this and in 101 meets throughout the day thank you for your presentation

thank you
