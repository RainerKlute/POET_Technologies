**Adrian Brijbassi:** Exciting news has been announced as POET Technologies will partner with NTT, a Japanese telecom giant on an application specifically for the high-growth AI connectivity market. Here to discuss the news is POET’s Chief Revenue Officer, Raju Kankipati. Raju, what can you tell us about this announcement regarding NTT and POET?

**Raju Kankipati:** Hi, Adrian. Yes, this is such an exciting moment for us at POET. We are partnered with NTT Innovative Devices, a subsidiary of NTT, to develop a highly integrated and scalable solution for next-generation mobile front-haul networks.

NTT is one of the world’s largest telecom providers. They’re like the AT&T in the States. So this collaboration is a validation of how far we have come along in our effort to establish the POET Optical Interposer as one of the best integration platforms for high-speed optical communications.

And this shows how versatile the platform is to address different markets with its unique capabilities.

**Adrian Brijbassi:** And NTT presents a brand new market for POET. Can you explain the significance of that move and how it speaks to the flexibility of the optical interposer platform?

**Raju Kankipati:** Sure. Until now, all our customers, design wins, and collaborations have been focused on data centers, cloud, and AI network buildouts. This will be our first entry into the access network market.

Mobile front-haul is a massive market which enables the connectivity of the billions of mobile devices, especially in 4G and 5G networks.

Of course, this collaboration aims at the next generation of the mobile front-haul technology, which will address the use of artificial intelligence applications on mobile devices. The technical challenges of such networks are different from that of data centers. For example, most mobile front-haul networks, they use bi-directional links, also called bi-di. They use a single fiber for both transmit and receive signals and use a built-in filter to separate the signals.

The POET Optical Interposer is a great fit for such applications because on top of our well-known differentiations, like integration of optical and electrical components, passive assembly at wafer scale, and hybrid integration, we can also build the passive filters monolithically on the interposer platform. This means everything can be done on a single chip that can be passively assembled at wafer scale. This can be a huge market for POET.

**Adrian Brijbassi:** While the NTT revenue is still months in the future, there’s still a lot of activity with our existing customers. What can you tell us about those engagements?

**Raju Kankipati:** We recently received the AI Breakthrough Award for Hardware Innovation. This was the second time in a row for our 1.6 Teralight engines. There’s been a lot of customer interest in sampling our 1.6 T engines. So our team is busy building these samples for customers in our Malaysia factory while getting ready for production of 400 gig and 800 gig engines. There’s a lot of work ahead of us, but this is exciting times as we are switching gears from an engineering organization to a volume production organization.

**Adrian Brijbassi:** And last question, what role will the new manufacturing facility in Malaysia play in fulfilling the work specifically that you have to do for NTT?

**Raju Kankipati:** So as we recently announced, we are focusing all our production facilities in the Malaysia region. So we have partnered with other manufacturers who have established giant facilities dedicated to POET. All our equipment, state-of-the-art optical die bonders, electrical die bonders, testers, burn-in equipment, they’re all getting ready to start the volume ramp later part of this year.

**Adrian Brijbassi:** Thanks for that exceptional update, Raju. I think you’re heading back to Singapore. Safe travels. We’ll look forward to speaking to you again soon.

**Raju Kankipati:** Thanks, Adrian.
