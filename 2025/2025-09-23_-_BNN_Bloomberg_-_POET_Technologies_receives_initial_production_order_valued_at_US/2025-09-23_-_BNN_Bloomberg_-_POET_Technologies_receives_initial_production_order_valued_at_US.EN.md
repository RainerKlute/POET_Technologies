**Interviewer:** POET Technologies is based in Toronto, although it trades on the Nasdaq.
The market cap is about $540 million U.S. That stock was higher today.
The company received what it's calling an initial production order from one of its
lead customers.
It's not a huge deal.
It's valued at more than half a million dollars U.S.
We're joined by Suresh Venkatesan.
He joins us now.
This is for an optical engine.
Can you tell us, please, what is an optical engine?

**Suresh Venkatesan:** Yeah, hi.
First, thanks for having me on the show.
POET makes optical interposer technology-based products, and the output of that is what
we call an optical engine.
Just like the engine in a car that powers, I guess, an automobile, the optical engines
are essentially the primary piece of hardware that converts electricity into light in telecommunication
networks.
We're happy to be an integrator and a provider of these optical engines that are
used in AI as well as data communication networks.

**Interviewer:** If I was sending signals over a fiber optic network, for example, would I use one
of your devices?

**Suresh Venkatesan:** Yeah, absolutely.
We've been developing our technology over the past several years, but we're rolling out our 800-gig
products, and we had a fantastic showing in China just a week ago on our cutting-edge 1.6 terabit per second
optical engines that we developed in conjunction with Mitsubishi, and that, along with some of our
scale-up network solutions, we expect that to underpin our growth over the coming years.

**Interviewer:** But are you a startup in the sense that your revenue is not huge, as far as I can see?
You don't have big, established sales right now?

**Suresh Venkatesan:** Yeah, I guess we're a technologically and functionally a startup, although we do trade on the
Nasdaq, and we're generating de minimis revenue now with NRE contracts with customers.
As we said earlier, we're gearing up for production. We just established a manufacturing
facility in Malaysia earlier this year that can produce a million optical engines a year,
which we think is essential to attract larger purchase orders from our customers.
And we'd also said that we would be starting production in the fourth quarter of this year,
so this is essentially a testament to the team as well as what we discussed on our roadmap,
which is to start generating product revenue. Of course, what we announced is in the beginning,
and we expect that to continue over the next several quarters.

**Interviewer:** Right, yeah. I see your revenue in your latest quarter was almost $270,000.
Where was the technology developed, Suresh?

**Suresh Venkatesan:** Well, the technology was largely developed here in the United States, which is where I am,
and we have a large team in Singapore, so I think our primary research and development
facility is based in Singapore with support from our facility in Shenzhen in China,
but our manufacturing site is in Penang in Malaysia. But much of the, I guess,
the brains behind the technology has been developed here in the United States.

**Interviewer:** Right, and what's your Canadian connection then?

**Suresh Venkatesan:** POET is headquartered in Toronto, so we're a foreign public issuer on the U.S. markets,
but we're fundamentally a Canadian company. We were listed on the Toronto Venture Exchange
until recently, so I think our genesis and roots are in Canada, and we're still proud to
be a Canadian company.

**Interviewer:** That's interesting. What do your devices do that existing ones don't?

**Suresh Venkatesan:** What POET provides is what we call chip-scale wafer-level manufacturing. This is
not indistinct from what semiconductors do in the world today, but the world of optics has
not yet adopted the economies of scale that comes with wafer-scale manufacturing,
and so what POET's been providing are integration solutions for optical devices
using semiconductor-like wafer-scale manufacturing, and especially in this era
where AI is just making great demands on the optical industry, both for their scale-out networks
as well as their upcoming scale-up networks. We think that providing economy of scale and
the ability to produce massive quantities of these optical devices is going to be really
important, and so we've been trailblazing our interposer concept that provides this kind of
wafer-scale semiconductor-like manufacturing processes to the world of optics that heretofore
has largely relied on, I would say, discrete assembly as opposed to integrated assembly.

**Interviewer:** That's fascinating that the photonics or optronics world has been slightly behind
the regular semiconductor industry in that sense.

**Suresh Venkatesan:** Oh, absolutely. I think leading-edge semiconductors, of course, trailblaze and then
MEMS and optics and all of these other technologies that are critical,
but they've been trailing behind in terms of the level of integration and level of automation,
but now that's changing with POET providing its interposer solutions
as well as other companies adopting the concept of integration.
It's becoming more and more mainstream. Four years ago, when we started developing the
concepts around the interposer, we were arguably ahead of our time, but now we're in the right
place at the right time with the right solutions and we're engaging with some of the biggest
customers in the world and working closely with them to address their needs for more compute
power, especially in these new artificial intelligence systems and networks. We're happy
with the position we're in and we're capitalizing on the interest of our customers
and collaborating with them to develop new solutions.

**Interviewer:** Suresh, thanks very much indeed. Suresh Venkatesan is the executive
chairman and CEO at POET Technologies.
