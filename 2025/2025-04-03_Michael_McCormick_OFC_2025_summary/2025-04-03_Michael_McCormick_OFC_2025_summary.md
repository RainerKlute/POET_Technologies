## Introduction and setting the scene

As I balance my iPad on a United Airline tray between my chicken pizzaiola (no idea what that is, but it tastes good) and my vodka cranberry and the window on my right, I’ll try to summarize my impressions from the OFC this week. I had 3 primary objectives in coming to the OFC conference this week:

1. Talk to a broad group of people in the industry to gain a sense for how the market perceives POET as a company and the solutions they offer.
2. Verify, directly with POET partners/customers, that there is tangible progress being made toward integrating partner components with the Optical Interposer and creating sellable modules.
3. Meet the POET team and evaluate whether or not I believe they are capable of building a multi-billion dollar company based on their expertise, industry connections, technology, professionalism, and other attributes.

## Assessment of the POET team

I’ll address #3 first. I had an opportunity to speak with Dr. Suresh V. (CEO), Thomas Mika (CFO), Raju K (CRO), Mo Jinyu (GM, Asia), and Adrian Brijbassi, who is responsible for corporate communications. I’ve worked in the IT industry my entire career, primarily in early-stage companies, and, based on my experience, I can say without hesitation that POET has a top-notch, professional team of experts. In addition to being experts in their field, they clearly work extremely hard – a level of effort that’s required in an early-stage company breaking into the market with a new approach to a compelling problem.

And, as I walked the floor at the conference and name-dropped POET as a company and each of these POET execs, I was pleasantly surprised by how many people know POET and respect their leadership. Most of the transceiver manufacturers I met with knew Suresh and Raju, and it seems that everyone from Asia knows and respects Mo.

Therefore, regarding #3, I am fully confident in POET and POET’s execs. It is truly amazing what they are accomplishing with a small team of professionals. Kudos POET.

## Industry perception of POET

Regarding #1 (how do experts in the industry perceive POET and the prospects for POET’s success), this required a LOT of walking around the exhibition floor and a lot of conversations with people. I’d guess that 9 out of 10 of the module manufacturers on the floor I spoke with were familiar with POET. So, I’ve certainly validated that POET is known and respected in the industry.

Surprisingly, I didn’t hear ANY negative comments about POET’s technology or prospects for success. The consensus seems to be that POET has developed something unique and valuable. The primary area of “concern” (or, “uncertainty” may be a better word), relates to whether or not POET will be able to scale quickly to meet market demands. This is a fair question, especially after the initial engagement with Sanan and the SPX.

POET is now closing down SPX and moving equipment to Malaysia where experts in wafer level manufacturing are available to POET. Production is ALREADY in progress in Malaysia, as POET is currently using the equipment acquired from Rockley (for pennies on the dollar). The passive assembly process will allow for high volume manufacturing and scaling to meet market needs. Suresh compares this process as being similar to the improved efficiencies gained through Ford’s assembly line manufacturing. Therefore, questions about “ability to scale” should fade away as the market witnesses what POET is accomplishing.

The concern for some investors, which is recognized by experts in the industry as being “standard process”, is the timeline from partner validation to customer testing to customer orders and revenue. It takes time. These large data centers and hyperscalers have to run new technology for up to 5,000 hours, so 6 to 9 months AFTER POET and their partners validate the solution and deliver it to customers to test.

I was told by a lead technical contact from Mitsubishi who works directly with POET that this process can be accelerated if customers have an urgent requirement, and he said that they have customers with urgent requirements. More on Mitsubishi later, but I’ll offer this quote from the Mitsubishi contact – “After customers validate this in their data centers the Flood Gates Will Open”.

So, I view the concern about time to value for this investment as being negligible because the investment community will drive the value of POET up significantly as customers proceed with in-house testing. Revenue generated from these customers will be significant, and both retail and institutional investors want to get in BEFORE the sp explodes.

As an example of this, the multibillion dollar valuation for Celestial AI isn’t based on current revenue – there is no revenue. But there’s strong evidence that there will be in the future. Just as with POET. And, one announcement about one large data center customer validating POET solutions will likely result in a sp spike (any day).

## Customer and partner perception

I can most effectively speak to #2 by describing my meetings directly with POET partners. I’ll start with Mitsubishi Electric, for no other reason than the segue is smoother if I stay with Mitsubishi story.

### Mitsubishi

The Optical Interposer with Mitsubishi EMLs is running live at the POET booth. It works. It’s been tested by both companies. POET and Mitsubishi will now collaborate with a module manufacturer to complete modules to be tested by customers. It’s real. It’s going to happen. And the market will be big.

A Mitsubishi technical contact told me that the demand for lasers will outpace the industry’s production capabilities. POET’s architecture provides the unique advantage of reducing the number of lasers required while providing all the value of speed, energy efficiency, lower heat, and passive production.

They believe this is a game changer, as it will help Mitsubishi deliver viable solutions to their customers without constraints from laser production. Multiple contacts from Mitsubishi told me that they already have customers requesting their EML’s and the POET optical interposer.

### Adtran

Adtran is utilizing POET Technologies’ multi-engine optical engines in their MicroMux™ Quattro product. Specifically, these are POET’s multi-engine transmit and receive chips, which incorporate multiple instances of industry-standard 100GBASE-LR4 (for 10km applications) and 100GBASE-CWDM4 (for 2km applications) functionalities on a single optical engine. These optical engines are based on POET’s proprietary Optical Interposer™ platform, enabling a highly integrated, chip-on-board solution that powers the Quattro 100G LR4 module. This module packs the functionality of four independent 100Gbit/s interfaces into a single QSFP-DD form factor, quadrupling the density of 100G ports in 400G switch and routing platforms.

I attempted to meet with Stephan Neidlinger, Global Bus Dev VP, and Ross Saunders, General Manager for Adtran Optical Engines, but they were both tied up in their private meeting room all week. I assume this is good news for POET investors, because Adtran was demonstrating their Micromux Quattro product in these meetings. Ross was quoted recently saying, "POET is deserving of industry recognition because of the innovation they have achieved with their optical engines. We value their efforts in helping us to create a next-generation optical module that addresses the demand for greater connectivity”.

I spoke with another gentleman from Adtran bus dev group, and he very enthusiastically explained that POET provides them the industry ONLY solution for “breaking out” four 100G channels from a 400G port.

Tom Mika further explained to me that data centers globally have standardized on 400G ports in routers and switches, but that the telco providers can only deliver 100G, so 75% of the capacity of the 400G port is wasted. With POET, and now with the Adtran Micromux Quattro, the 400G port can be broken into 4 100G transceivers connecting to the telco. This is huge (at least the guy from Adtran was excited about it..).

Adtran has tested and validated the solution, they are demonstrating it, and customers are interested in pursuing this solution for their data centers. Adtran has a large presence at OFC. A lot of end users (Hyperscalers and data center managers) were there, and many of these contacts met with Adtrans with a specific focus on the new Micromux Quattro solution.

### Luxshare

Mike Gao is the GM of Luxshare’s opto-electronic division, he oversees the strategic direction of Luxshare’s optical products, including those integrating POET’s technology. I’m embarrassed to say that I spoke with someone in the booth who I thought was Mike, but now I am unsure, so I’ll just say I spoke with someone very knowledgeable about POET and the Luxshare partnership.

Luxshare has an 800G module solution based on the optical interposer that has already been validated, and they had it available at the conference. I was told that they are very pleased with the solution and that they do have customer demand for the product. In fact, he stated that they already have a large hyperscaler customer who has placed orders for the solution.

I didn’t dig further because being overly assertive can be counterproductive in these situations. But I heard what he said. And, I am very encouraged. This, again, is the type of validation I was seeking in attending OFC.

### Foxconn FIT

Foxconn didn’t have a booth at the conference, they only had a private meeting room to engage with customers. So, I was unable to meet with anyone from the company. I did meet with Adam Carter, who recently assumed the CEO role at OpenLight and who previously worked for Foxconn FIT as the Chief Commercial Officer of the Fiber Optics Communications Business and was a primary contact for the POET engagement. OpenLight is not a direct competitor to POET, and Raju confirmed that POET is still actively working with FIT.

POET and FIT have been working together since May 2024 to develop 800G and 1.6T pluggable optical transceiver modules using POET’s optical engines, and they anticipated ramping production in 2H 2025. Initially, the manufacturing was slated to occur at SPX. Based on my conversations, there’s no indication that timelines have slipped as a result of the transition to the Malaysia manufacturing facility. In fact, with all equipment in place, production MAY be accelerated (my speculation – not a quote from anyone involved).

### ZKTel

This is a good opportunity to explain why POET closed the SPX facility, because it was SPX that was supposed to produce the OI for ZKTel. My understanding is that they had orders, but SPX became a bottleneck due to the operational and business processes required by Sanan. Tom described this as a situation where a big company (Sanan) with slow moving processes and unrealistic margin demands was working with a small company (POET), which requires flexibility and responsiveness to customer needs.

The marriage didn’t work well, so POET bought them out and they’re shipping the equipment to Malaysia. This is in process, and the machinery will “very quickly” help POET ramp production. Further, SPX (and that region of China) didn’t have the wafer level manufacturing expertise required with the new POET architecture. POET has this expertise in Malaysia.

Bottom line, it was a prudent move for POET, but I believe the 100G modules intended for ZKTel were not produced. I don’t know if ZKTel will remain a potential customer or not.

### Mentech

The business relationship between Mentech Technology and POET Technologies centers on a strategic partnership where Mentech has selected POET’s transmit and receive optical engines for the development of high-speed 800G pluggable transceivers, with plans to extend this to 1.6T optical modules. This collaboration, announced on September 10, 2024, involves Mentech placing initial purchase orders for POET’s optical engines, which are used for engineering development and early builds.

Mentech, a major global supplier of data communications and telecommunications components, aims to leverage POET’s Optical Interposer technology to enhance its product offerings for AI system operators and hyperscale data centers.

I met with Dr. Qian Yinbo, Chief Technology Officer at Mentech, during the conference. He told me that they are already demonstrating the 800G pluggable (with POET’s Optical Interposer) and in the process of validating the 1.6T. For a techie guy, he was animated about the partnership and the technology that POET offers. He confirmed that they already have customers requesting the 800G modules, so I assume they are in the test and validation phase in these customer data centers. Mentech has customers with large data centers, and they serve the major hyperscalers also. This is another partnership that will inevitably produce revenue for POET.

### Lessenger

I met with Taeyong Kim, Chief Marketing Officer for Lessenger. Lessenger has a proprietary technology that optimizes performance of their pluggable transceivers, and they have integrated their modules with the POET Optical Interposer. They were demonstrating the 800G pluggable (with POET inside), and they are currently validating the 1.6 modules. Taeyong confirmed that they already have customers interested in (in process of testing) the 800G modules they have produced. This is another POET partner that will inevitably produce revenues and, frankly, as I continue to describe the activity and progress that is occurring I am dumbfounded by the investment community’s inability to recognize POET’s value. Yet, I am confident that it will happen. (Likely suddenly and emphatically)

## Other prospective business partners

I met with a number of other module manufacturers who could be plausible POET partners. Companies such as AOI, Jabil, Sivers, NewPhotonics, and more. I’d be swimming out of my lane if I commented on the potential for a productive partnership between POET and these companies. They know POET, though. POET knows them. And, I’m now confident that as POET continues to prove the value of their platform they will become engaged with more and more of these module manufacturers.

In fact, Tom Mika confirmed for me that POET is not pursuing the development of their own modules. This was a previously stated strategy, but as these partnerships developed into significant GTM plans with a broad set of POET’s partners, POET made the decision to focus on supplying the OI to these module manufacturers without developing their own. They didn’t want to compete with their customers. Smart move.

## Conclusion and final thoughts

My vodka cranberry is drained. My chicken (whatever that was) is finished. And, the plane is descending toward Denver. I’m done. I hope this was insightful for POET investors. Needless to say, this trip validated my enthusiasm regarding my personal POET investment. “Fasten your seatbelts, stow away your tray table, and bring your seat back to the forward and most uncomfortable position”. Time to go home.
