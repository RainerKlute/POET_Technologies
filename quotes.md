## Dr. Suresh Venkatesan

“POET makes optical modules that enable optical data transmission. And this is fundamental
to scaling the presence of AI. Others make optical modules as well. But POET has developed
unique intellectual property that allows us to make these modules better, cheaper, lower
power, and larger scale than anyone else. More than cost or bill of sales it is the scale
where POET shines.”
